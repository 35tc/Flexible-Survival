		say "    Walking through the high-rise district you walk close to a jewelry store. As you are about to go past, you suddenly hear a small commotion from inside, as if shelves are being ransacked. In an environment where the dollar is useless, it makes sense that gold, silver, and jewels would be valuable items ideal for more cognizant looters. Curious to see who is doing the looting, you peer through the open door of the place. Inside the store you see a wolverine security guard in some sort of semiconscious trance just staring straight ahead. The display cases have had their valuables purloined, shards of glass from the shattered coverings line the otherwise surprisingly shiny marble floor. Looking over to the cash register location you observe an infected avian with vibrant green plumage picking a gold necklace and putting it into a small brown sack. He has his back turned to you, preoccupied with finding loot, he softly sings a calming tune. The song eases your nerves and you start to walk towards the bird, until you feel a small crunch as you step on a shard of glass and the busy burglar turns to look at you.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     As he glances towards you, it becomes apparent that purloiner is a peacock anthro infected male. Covered in shimmering blue and green covered feathers, he stands in a striking pose. As he looks you over, his eyes focus intently like he has found something very valuable. If beaks could smile, then he would wear a broad and satisfied one right now.  Then the peacock burglar starts to fan his tail. The feathers are quite eye catching indeed. With a very calm and soothing voice he says, 'Hello, there, It's been a while since I've seen another cognizant person, let alone one so [if player is female]beautiful[else]attractive[end if]'.";
		say "      Managing to wrench your gaze away from the bird, you focus on the dazed wolverine instead. Without a doubt something the peacock did put the guard out of commission... so you prepare to be wary towards the avian. As if to address this the resplendent peafowl states, 'I was simply walking down the street and got too close to this store when the guard started to attack me.' Skeptically you raise an eyebrow, something about the location of the guard and the empty display cases poke holes in his testimony. But after a couple of waves of his tail feathers somehow... you just want to let him continue... 'I don't mean you any harm. Let me prove it to you. I can give a dynamite massage,' the sleek male says in a calming and inviting tone. With all the chaos going in the city it might be good for him to help you relax a little bit... Wait! Some small wary part of your mind feels very skeptical of his intentions. Are you really going to allow him to work his magic on you?";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     [bold type]Something about the way the avian moves seems incredibly inviting... yet also potentially dangerous. Will you allow the stunning peacock to help you relax, or will you warn the fowl to back off and not try anything funny?[roman type][line break]";

		say "     ([link]Y[as]y[end link]) - Let the bird give you a soothing massage.";

		if player consents:
			say "     You comply with his request to give you a massage. The inviting eyes of the bird almost seem to shine as he invites you to take a seat on a comfy black leather chair. Eyeing your body, the would-be masseuse kneels in front of you. A piece of broken glass is reflecting a glaring ray of light into your eyes. To deal with this issue the peacock fans out his feathers to block the distraction, as well as provide a striking visual for you to stare at. When your eyes focus on one of the turquoise eye-spots on one of his regal tail feathers the masculine bird coos encouragingly, 'Yes... stare into the spot... and reelaxxx...' As you focus in on the eye-spot, your relaxation consultant slowly sways making the eye-spot you are intently look at sway in a slight pendulum motion. You can feel your muscles grow warm as tension eases from then.";
			say "     Starting to gently stroke your arms the male fowl says, 'I can tell these muscles have seen a lot of use, fighting and fleeing from monsters... scavenging resources, exploring the city... puts quite a strain on the body... Now that you are here with me just let that tension melt away. His soft flexible feathered fingers trace up and down your arms. This feels so relaxing... Soon your shoulders and torso is the focus of the peacock's efforts. 'Yess... just relax... focus on the eye-spot and let me make you feel good,' says the captivating stud as he moves his hands over your waist. Your thoughts start to dull as you are entranced by the glimmering eye-spots[if breast size of player > 4]. The feathered hands roam over your shapely breasts. You bite your lip as silky soft feathered digit circles a nipple[end if]. His hands begin roaming down to your groin.";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     As he strokes and caresses your pelvis the peacock temptingly asks, 'Would you like to feel even better?' Lost in a sea of delight, all you can do is nod your head. With a beaming voice,the entrancing male leans forward and softly nibbles on your neck whispering, 'Good... good...' into your ear, encouraging you to submit to the haze of pleasure. Then he says, 'You would feel much better if you were naked... Any clothing or equipment you wear while I help you relax will weigh you down and remind of all the worries of our strife-worn city. You can let go of all these worries for just a little while...' For some strange reason, you agree with the man and strip off anything you wear. Naked as the day you were born, all your worries and anxieties fall by the wayside. With encouraging words the elegant peacock guides you to recline in a comfy position on the chair.  His hand then goes lower towards your loins.";
			If cunts of player > 0:
				say "     The feather-covered hands of the captivating male start to caress the folds of your pussy causing you to feel a pleasurable tingling sensation. You open your mouth to say something, but the dommy bird puts a finger to your lips and soothingly says, 'Don't talk... just feel...' A surge of pleasure runs through you as he sticks his index finger inside your eager pussy. Using smooth confident motions, the peafowl's second and third fingers are inserted into your cunt as well in short notice. The hypnotizing male's fingers are quite dexterous, finding some of the most sensitive parts of your womanhood. 'It feels good to have me inside you... doesn't it...' says the peacock drawing out his words to help keep you entranced. You can't help but moan loudly. It feels soo goood... Your mind gets foggy as the urge to cum rises. The green and blue feathered avian eggs you on and on, eager to see you orgasm. Then finally, your muscles tense up and you cum. Your mind blanks with only the feeling of pleasure running up and down your nerves.";
				say "     As you start to come to some time later, you see the peacock with his arms embracing you. His body warmth and smooth feathers provide a comforting touch for you skin. The mannish avian traces a hand all along your body. Whispering in your ear, the tall and slender fowl repeats the phrase, 'You came because you were a good girl... Good girls want to please me... You want to please me...' To your surprise, you can see your lips moving as if to repeat the phrase. Noticing that you are coming to, the captivating stud gives a throaty chuckle and declares, 'You seem a lot more relaxed. I hope that has shown just how skilled I am at helping people let go of their worries. You seem like the sort of lady who could... regularly need some help alleviating stress. Come find me at the Argos Antique Store. Knock three times on the back entrance. I hope to see you later, beautiful.' Grabbing the bag of loot the avian heads out the door. You smile and think perhaps you may pay him a visit, to see the charmer and his [bold type]captivating plumage[roman type] again.";

You begin to say something but are quickly hushed by the avian placing a feathered finger up to your mouth and saying, 'Lets put that mouth to better use...' He then begins bring his beak close to your mouth. His tongue then darts into your mouth and begins to play with your tongue. The captivating feathered male is skilled at using his tongue to enrapture you. [If cocks of player > 0]His hand runs up and down your shaft, making your cock rise. Between passionate kisses, the fowl runs a finger around your cock-head playfully saying, 'Let's have you think with this head instead.' [end if]As the passionate make-out and groping by the dominant male goes on, all you can think of is the pleasure he gives you. The urge to climax grows steadily until all you can do is beg for release. 'Cum...' whispers the peacock and you lose yourself in pleasure.";

			say "     Something about this deceptive bird strikes you as very duplicitous. You yell at the bird to stay away and not do anything funny. With a glum look on his face, the avian runs out the back entrance with his bag of loot, muttering about how you were too strong willed. Somehow you get the feeling that this particular peacock will not cross paths with you again.";

		say "     As you walk through the high-rise district, you pass by the antique store of that intriguing peacock. As if compelled by some outside force, you head close to examine the place. Outside the store is a sign with a Greek trireme with the words Argos Antiques. The ancient Greek warship has a feather emblazoned upon its unfurled sail and the eyes painted on the ship's bow seem to follow your movement. The front of the store is barricaded with heavy wooden furniture. Through a small opening in the boarded-up window you see a suit of armor with a large halberd pointed at the opening. Startled you jolt back from the peep hole, but realize it was probably put there to keep nosy ferals away. The instructions that the green and blue feathered anthro gave to you reverberate through your mind. As if by instinct you head for the back entrance and knock three times.";
		say "     A short moment later, the avian opens the door and says with a happy tone, 'I thought you'd never come.' Hurriedly, he waves you inside. The store is filled with a large assortment of items and pieces from various eras. Most of the furniture has been moved to block the entrance, leaving a variety of paintings hanging on the walls, surrounding blank spots where shelves stood not too long ago. There even is one that you recognize as a piece by a famous local artist, advertised in the paper as part of an art exhibit worth tens of thousands of dollars. A variety of weapons hang in racks behind the cashier's location. Various sabers, six-shooters and rifles from the frontier era shine brightly, obviously well-polished. Towering stacks of old books are piled on the floor, hastily removed to lighten up the shelves before they were moved. Some of them have not fared too well due to this treatment and scattered pieces of old paper lie strewn across the ground.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     'Sorry about the mess, I've been meaning to clean up, but haven't found the time. I don't suppose you could be a [if cunts of player > 0]good girl [else]good boy [end if]and help me clean up?' For some strange reason your crotch feels tingly and to your surprise, you instantly agree without a second thought. You bend over and start to pick up all the various loose pages. While doing so, out of the corner of your eye you can see the confident peafowl staring at your ass. Soon, he says in a soft tone, 'Thank you for helping me picking up the place, with the way everything is in the city, finding a good [if cunts of player > 0]girl [else]guy[end if] is a rarity...' Something about the way he praises you makes you grin a little and a small part of you starts to get aroused.";
		say "     As you put the inch-thick pile of paper you have collected so far into the cardboard box he indicates, the resplendent bird starts to fan out his beautiful feathers and runs his hands along your waist. He hums a pleasant tune and whispers sensually in your ear, 'You are doing a fantastic job of pleasing me... I think I know of a way that will make both of us relax...' You start to feel the tapered tip of the captivating male's avian cock rub against your ass. Strangely one of your hands seem to move of its own accord behind you and begins to wrap around the rod. Startled, you turn your body around and attempt to regain volition of your hand, but that just makes things worse, as your gaze is drawn to the fanned-out feathers and their gentle sway left and right. The more you try to resist, the less control you seem to have...";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     Your fingers begin to curl around his 9 inch shaft with the thumb swirling around the tip. By now the avian's shaft is fully erect, with a short grunt the dommy male utters, 'Just relaxxx... let your body guide you...' A pleasurable sensation seems to radiate from your fingers and through your veins down to the rest of your body. Between this sensation and an unwillingness to lose control of the rest of your body, you submit to the enthralling anthro male's demands. As soon as you resign yourself to giving the peacock a handjob, you start to regain control of your hands. But then, as thoughts of doing anything else vanish from your mind, you realize that this is just the proper thing to do anyways and focus on the large cock in front of you.";
		say "     The frills on top of the peacock's head stand fully upright as your hands roam over his bird-like shaft. Strangely your arms start to feel better like any fatigue you have carried from travelling through post-apocalyptic city slowly is erased from your appendages. Unable to think about anything other than how to get the bird to cum, you wrap both of your hands around the surprisingly large rod and vigorously pump the pinkish dick, only pausing to fondle his balls[if breast size of player > 4] or to tit-fuck him using your ample bosom[end if]. Soon, he hastily pulls your head close for a kiss, at the same time as the peacock's sizable orbs tense up and semen spurts over your body. After the avian has released his load, he spreads his tail-feathers wide, dominating your field of vision with those vibrant... colorful... eyes... ";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     Regaining your faculties some time later, you find yourself sitting in an overstuffed armchair, an old quilted blanket wrapped around you. Despite only getting an hour of sleep at most, you feel as if you slept for a solid eight hours. Sitting on a large leather chair, the peacock notices you come to and happily says, 'Look who is awake. You did an amazing job making me happy. You should really be proud of just how instinctively your body seeks pleasure and relaxation. If you are wound up too tight, you won't be able to notice an ambush or attack. Another individual I met refused my offer and got pounced on by a leopardman only seconds later. I really do hope you come back another time.' With that said, he gently tugs the blanket off you, then ushers you out the door. As much as it pains you to admit it, but you do feel a lot better. Hopefully next time you will have a more control on how the situation pans out. But then... the [bold type]captivating plumage[roman type] of your avian friend is so hard to resist.";

		say "     As you walk through the streets of the high-rise district you somehow find yourself heading back to the antique store. Remembering how you lost volition of your hand last time, you wonder just how much control you had in arriving at this place. Despite your weariness, you can't help but to knock on the rear door. You hear the sounds of taloned footsteps on hardwood floor then the clanks of the chains unlocking the door. Beckoning you inside, the peacock guides you to a pair of soft leather chairs and invites you to sit in one. The chairs squeaks as you take a seat. Opening a small oaken chest, the blue and green feathered shopkeeper grabs a small water bottle inside and hands it to you. Taking a seat on the chair facing you, the avian states, 'I've just realized that despite our... interactions, I still haven't introduced myself. My name's Dmitri, welcome to my humble shop. It looks a lot better since you came around...'";
		say "     As the two of you start a casual discussion on the conditions of life in the post-nanite infection city, you learn how Dmitri was given ownership of the store from the previous owner. Gazing with a wistful look in his eyes he says, 'She said I was the only one she ever knew who appreciated what these old things mean to society. It's why I bring the items here. All this history and craftsmanship could be wiped out in a second, either broken in pile of rubble from some infected fighting, or ruined by various substances like that wyvern goop or all cum coating almost every place in the city. I'd rather these works of art be with people who will take good care of them.' While you do admit this rationale does seem admirable, it doesn't hurt that he will probably get a decent amount of money if things ever get resolved and he can sell what he stole. Once you have finished your water, the peacock guides you through a tour of his shop.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     Passing by the halberd-wielding suit of armor you saw previously, the avian notes where your eyes gaze and states, 'I got that piece from a person who lives in town. I wonder how Bain is doing nowadays...' Walking by a counter covered with aged knick-knacks and miscellaneous items, the confident shopkeeper boasts how he was able to charm some debutante into selling all these items for about a 1/4th of what they actually were worth. Picking up a golden mirror and hands it to you. While you look in the mirror at your [facename of player], the fowl starts going on about the history of the piece. You catch a small glint in his eye as he says in a seemingly off the cuff way, 'Please do be careful with that precious antique - I would just hate if slipped out of your fingers...' As if on cue, your hands begin to feel shaky and the mirror falls out of your hand and onto the ground, scattering the glass all over the floor. Embarrassed, you pick up a small broom and dustpan and start sweeping up the pieces.";
		say "     Getting down on your knees, you are able to brush up all the pieces of broken glass off of the floor. Shamefully you dump the shards into the garbage can. As you turn your head back to see the peacock playing with the golden frame in his hands. With a teasing tone Dmitri says, 'Such a shame that this got ruined... it was pretty... and so very, very expensive. You'll have to work hard to pay for breaking it...' The fact that the avian's dick is alread half-hard is a very strong hint as to what is required as compensation. Your mind seems to brush off any possible alternatives for restitution. Patting the top of your head, the green and blue feathered male guides your lips to the tapered tip of his cock. As your tongue begins to lick the tip of his shaft, it tastes irresistible. You can't quite pin the taste but something about it makes you want more.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     With a small groan the controlling avian asserts his control over you by placing his fingers on the back of your head and gently pushing your head forward. As good as the tip tasted, the shaft carries even more of that heady flavor. As his tail feather unfurl to provide a glamorous backdrop for the elegant male, your tongue coats his cock in a thick layer of saliva. This enables him to go even further into your mouth. The entrance of your throat can feel the tapered tip press against it. Pulling one hand off of the back of your head the fowl uses his free hand to close your eyelids softly saying, 'Close your eyes, focus only on pleasing me...' Complying with the avian's request, you keep your eyes closed and focus only on the rod currently inside your mouth. Savoring the experience, your focus only on how to give the best blowjob you can, bobbing your head at an increasingly faster pace.";
		say "     After approximately ten minutes of giving fellatio, you hear the sound of one of Dmitri's toe talons tense up and slide against the hardwood floor. A vein bulges in the shopkeeper's girthy avian cock, and you soon learn the reason why as the peafowl unleashes his load inside your mouth. The back of your mouth and throat are soon covered in a layer of cum. with a confident look on his face the enthralling male seductively says, 'Don't let a single drop touch the floor. I'd hate for you to have to clean up again.' Swallowing his thick load, your tongue soon licks over every square centimeter of his phallus. Pulling his dick from your face, the blue and green bird places his hand against your cheek and caresses it, 'I'm lucky to have met such a good [if player is female]lady[else]guy[end if] like yourself. If you keep showing up at this store I've got a plan which could use some help to complete. I think you'll find the reward and plan very fulfilling...' He waves you off for now as you try to learn more and guides you to the exit.";
