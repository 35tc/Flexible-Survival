However, this seems to be exactly what he wanted as he lines his erect, drooling cock up with you ass, roughly thrusting against it a few times before his tip sinks inside.";
			say "      You grit your teeth at the pain caused by the mostly unlubricated intrusion, but this doesn't deter the beast. He keeps pushing and pushing his [one of]rubbery[or]latex[at random] cock deeper and deeper, until his growing knot brushes against your entrance. You let out a groan, seeing the massive vulpine member distending your stomach. Against your will, you cock begins to harder, leaking pre and betraying your arousal.";

You only get a moment of reprieve, however, before he thrusts his tool back in up to the knot. He pulls back much more quickly this time, and thrusts in again. Slowly but surely, the beast picks up the pace, slamming his knot against your strained hole repeatedly. Your own unattended manhood bobs up in down from his rough thrusting jerking your body.";
			say "     His thrusts keep getting rougher and faster, before he eventually stops pulling out as far as he has been, only pulling out a few inches now. The fox growls possessively as he batters your hole, and pushes his knot harder and harder against it. Your eyes widen as you realize amidst the pain and pleasure that he's going to try tying you!";

			say "     True to your assumption, he backs up one last time before his softball-sized knot slams into your hole with a vengeance. But unlink the previous thrusts, he doesn't stop pushing after his knot hits you. He pushes harder and harder, determined to impale you with his knot before he finally succeeds, the ball of rubbery flesh slipping into you with a wet squelch, and a yip of pleasure from the rubber vulpine.";
			say "     Even without getting any treatment, you own cock erupts, orgasm strained from the pressure against your prostate, which actually seems to be growing! The latex fox's knot is swelling larger, firmly tying you to him as he begins to cum. Rope after rope of [one of]rubbery[or]slick[at random] fox seed fills your bowels. Quickly you begin to feel full, but he just keeps cumming. Your belly starts to distend from all the semen inside you. You start to look rather plump before the flow finally slows to a dribble. Yanking harshly on his knot, the fox manages to pull it out of your abused hole, a torrent of seed following it.";
