Looking around, most of it looks like it's been looted already, with shelves and displays being left barren. Towards the back of the shop, you can make out a vent. Looking closer, you see a red and white latex paw poking through the grating! The foreleg wiggles back and forth, it's owner seeming to have gotten stuck. The squeaks you were hearing are louder now, and there's a definite distressed sound to them that makes you feel almost bad for the stuck feral. Looking at the ground directly in front of the vent, you see what looks like a bike tire inner tube. It's just a few feet away from the fox's paw, and it's clear he was attempting to get a snack for himself when he got stuck.";

He lets out a rather startled yelp and begins yanking harder on his arm. You mumble something under your breath, wishing it would stop squirming so you could help it, and almost as if it can understand you, it calms down. With it relaxed, you put manage to slide the vent cover off of his paw. As soon as he's free, the rubber vulpine squeaks happily and darts back into the vent, disappearing from sight.";

Stepping inside, you don't even bother looking around before you go to the vent. You unfasten the cover again, pulling it, and the fox towards you. This time, he doesn't seem startled or scared. As a matter of fact, he almost looks, relieved. You gently free him from the grate, but this time, he doesn't dash back into the ductwork immediately. Instead, he leans down to grab the inner tube that's still laying there, picking it up. He turns to look at you before running back into the vents.";
		say "     Not bothering to put the cover back in place, you continue heading to the East Wing, a small smile on your [face of player] face. [bold type]Perhaps you could search around the mall to find how the fox got inside in the first place...[roman type]";

A couple seconds later, the shuffling stops and a black, red, and white rubber vulpine sticks his head through the grating with a determined squeak.
