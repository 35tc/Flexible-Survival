Section 1- Unorthodox Sight

Unorthodox Sight is a situation.
The sarea of Unorthodox Sight is "Red".
when play begins:
	add Unorthodox Sight to badspots of furry;
	add Unorthodox Sight to badspots of guy;

Instead of resolving a Unorthodox Sight:
	say "     Suddenly overcome by the sensation that something is wrong, you quickly whip your head around, looking this way and that in an attempt to figure out what is amiss. Due to having managed to brave a great deal of dangers already, you know it is wise to listen to your instincts when they tell you that something is off. For now the street seems empty, with nothing but the burned-out husks of buildings on the side opposite you and a row of uninteresting shops along your side of the street. They seem to be the kind of places that virtually nobody would ever actually bother going into. You assume they only managed to survive at all because the rent was cheap here right at the edge of the Red Light District. Focusing on your other senses, you then hear movement somewhere down the street and around a corner. Whoever it is doesn't appear to be in a rush, but even so, they'll be here soon enough.";
	say "     [bold type]What to do you want to do now?[roman type][line break]";
	LineBreak;
	say "     ([link]Y[as]y[end link]) - Hide and observe who or what it could be.";
	say "     ([link]N[as]n[end link]) - Just get out of here.";
	if player consents:
		LineBreak;
		say "      Against the side of the building nearest to you, you notice a delivery truck with the logo of a plumbing business on the side. Spotting a short stack of crates with what appears to be the same insignia as the truck, you rush over and crouch down behind them. Noticing the rather large cum stains on the side of the crates, you assume that the delivery driver had a bad day. Huddling down and scanning the area, you keep searching for any sign of danger, yet what appears a moment later is more peculiar than hostile. A quick glimpse over the edge of your boxes reveals two canine forms walking down the street together. Before ducking out of sight again, you notice that the smaller of the two is a feral walking on all fours, while the larger form is walking tall and proud on two legs beside it. They appear relaxed and happy from the way their tails are wagging, just out for a nice little stroll through the wild streets of this city.";
		say "     Since one can never be sure what any creature these days might do, you stay crouched behind your crates and don't reveal yourself. Once the pair walks past, you turn around to observe the two of them more closely. From your experiences in and around the city, you know that most of the time, bigger and tougher beings will utterly dominate the weak. This is clearly not the case here, as the comparably small feral fox is holding the grip of a leash between his teeth, which ends at a collar that his anthro wolf companion has strapped to his wrist as a cuff. Despite the fact that the wolf man is so much larger and more muscular than the fox, he allows himself to be led around quite happily.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     A moment later, you can see proof that the fox really is in control. He tugs the leash as they near a wrecked motorcycle in their path and the wolf obeys right away, moving over and walking around it - a weird relationship, but it seems to work for them. Silently studying the canines a little more openly, you see that the gray-furred wolfman is fully nude except for a red backpack strapped to his muscular back, with straps almost too small for his bulk. He is apparently large in all areas too, as you catch glimpses of a prodigious sheath and weighty balls that swing between his legs as he walks. At the same time, the fox seems utterly average in almost every regard, with nothing to differentiate him from a normal animal except the obvious intelligence he is demonstrating. The fur of the gray wolf's buttocks is matted and seems wet, which you quickly realize is due to the fresh cum oozing out of his asshole with every step as he is led along.";
		say "     Soon, the fox gives another tug on the leash and stops walking for a second, making his pet react by crouching down next to him and petting him in all of those hard to reach places. With a satisfied yip, the vulpine returns the affection of his companion, licking his muzzle and enjoying further grooming. He eventually leads the wolf onwards, soon vanishing from your sight around a corner. Once they are safely out of range, you get up from your hiding spot and stretch as you reflect on the unorthodox scene you witnessed.";
		increase FoxMasterEncounters by 1;
	else:
		LineBreak;
		say "     With the old saying [']Better safe than sorry['] in the forefront of your mind, you decide not to risk it and just dash the other way, quickly turning a corner. The swift escape avoids any contact at all between yourself and the unknown stranger, which is just fine in your book.";
	now Unorthodox Sight is resolved;

Section 2 - Desperation

[Moved to CEO1 file.]


Section 3 - Family Fun

Family Fun is a situation.
The sarea of Family Fun is "Beach".
when play begins:
	add Family Fun to badspots of furry;
	add Family Fun to badspots of guy;

Instead of resolving a Family Fun:
	say "     As you stroll down the beach, you spot a young male fox walking between two muscular wolves. The wolf on the left is the largest, with a wide and burly figure, while the one on the right is comparatively lithe. The fox between the two appears rather young, most likely a teenager. All three of them are completely naked, making no effort to conceal their sizeable sheaths and balls. Despite their altered bodies, they hold each other's hands like a family enjoying a vacation at the beach.";
	say "     You watch as the teenage vulpine looks between the two, presumably his guardians or parents, with a happy smile upon his narrow muzzle. You find your gaze locked to them as they continue down the beach. Curious about the peculiar sight, you follow a few yards behind them so as to not disturb their moment together. As the canine trio reaches a stretch of empty beach, they suddenly let go of their clasped hands and run away from the fox. You wonder why they would do that, only to realize with a start that they're actually playing a game of tag! While you watch, both of the big wolves take turns acting as the [']prey['] for the other two at a seemingly random interval. You take your leave as the game changes from tag to wrestling, quietly pleased that there is still something sweet left in the world despite the chaos and depravity of the city.";

Section 4 - Magic

Ritual Location is a situation.
The sarea of Ritual Location is "Mall".

Instead of resolving a Ritual Location:
	say "     Heading to the underground sanctum of the mall, aka the sewers, and vehemently wishing it was because you getting paid to see about a lost dog, you find yourself stopping dead in your tracks as you notice someone standing a fifteen feet away from where you are while holding a crystal ball into their hands. Blinking just to be sure that you are seeing right you find yourself going over to the other just in time to watch as the foot wide orb rises up into the air between the cloaked creature hands all the way until it is levitating in front of their unknown person's face. Seeing the other a lot clearer, once you've narrowed the distance between you both to a mere five feet, you find that you can't exactly make out what the other persona exactly is as the cloak and crystal ball hides the other's body and face, respectively, almost perfectly. Opening your mouth to speak you find yourself snapping your jaw shut when a single hand comes up and then waves a single gloved finger at you in admonishment. Not knowing what you did wrong you feel slightly chastised, that is, before the floating orbs comes directly over to hover unswervingly in front of your face.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Curiosity holds you still as you are not sure of what to do because of the oddity of the situation. You do manage to smile nervously into the beautifully polished ball however, as your reflection shows off your nervousness before gasping in trepidation as images of the city begin to pass over the rim of the ball. Like a TV screen flickering between channels you watch everything from mutants horses fucking each other in the park, to wanton and transformed police officers screwing feline prostitutes in the red light district, to doctors and nurses treating howling and transmogrifying patients in the nearby hospital, to wyverns flapping throughout the sky and getting shot down at by large cannons that the military have set up as a blockade to keep the creatures within the city limits until finally you see yourself again when the images come to a halt. 'This is your world as it is coming to be known by both those here and afar,' someone says, and instantly you find yourself trying to look at the cloaked figure in front of you. The crystal ball blocks off your sights of the other as you lift up and then down and then around to try and have a glance at the unknown person. The speaker, who you guess is the other person continues to talk, despite your humorous antics. 'How do you plan to go about surviving once the present danger has passed, I wonder? You have to know that those in power won't be able to keep this situation under control for too much longer...' A youthful voice asks and immediately you take a step back to have a look at the cloaked figure as the bubbling need to ask them what they mean surges throughout you.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Fear runs throughout your spine when you don't see the person right where they had been just minutes before. Whipping your head from side to side you try and see if you can find any trace of the unnamed individual your blood begins to run cold as you can find none. The only remnant that the other had even been is the crystal ball still floating listlessly in front of your face, but soon that too takes its leave of you. Shining brightly with an aurora of colors the orb blinks and then pops out of existence. Tiny trails of starry lights float down in the wake of the crystal's departure before they too fade out of existence. The sudden feeling of apprehension makes you take several steps back before you turn and then run away from where you had been, your mind frantically trying to reason with you over what just happened. A playfully jubilant voice chuckles in your ears, the sound being strangely reminiscent of that of the person who had just spoken to you, and quickly you make even faster tracks away from where you had just been. You've totally forgotten why you had even come here in the sewers in the first place.";

Section 5 - Auto Shop

Auto Shop is a situation.
The sarea of Auto Shop is "Red".
when play begins:
	add Auto Shop to badspots of furry;
	add Auto Shop to badspots of guy;

Instead of resolving a Auto Shop:
	say "     Making your way throughout the city's most notorious district you find yourself pausing as you hear the sounds of a car engine being revved into life. Thinking that maybe the military has found some way to get you, and the other sane civilians out of this hellhole, you quickly race over to a nearby auto shop, whose lights are surprisingly still on. Figuring that the small place must be running on some kind of generator you don't let your mental quandaries stop you from heading into the open garage and then... stopping so fast you nearly leave skid marks on the concrete. What you find inside is indeed an old 2004 four door sedan being accelerated into life, however that's the [italic type]minor[roman type] focus of your visual inspection as you find several canines, and a few feline mutants, all working together to get each other off in the most perverse and raunchy ways possible. Fucking... has long since come to be an outdated terminology for what's happening in here as large dobermans with both six packs and pot bellies rut hard fucksticks inside of the bubbled asses of collies, wolves, and slim felines alike. The stench of male musk is almost stifling in here and you have to take a step back as you try not to suffocate from underneath the heavy fumes of sweat soaked scents billowing into the air.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     With all of this debauchery going on you, after shaking your head to free up your mind, wonder who in the world is gunning the motor of the sedan. Your answer comes when you see a large jaguar rising up and down inside of the front seat of the car as [italic type]something[roman type] manhandles the feline into being thrust up and down into its lap. With the window of the vehicle broken you can see clearly that the muzzle of the jag is parted and drool is leaking from out the sides of the yowling feline's maw as the other gets pounded harder and harder by the unknown creature behind it. You don't even want to say [italic type]man[roman type] because in this fucked up city there are no longer just men who can deep dick your ass as something quite new has been added to the fairer sex of the once human species. You can't see that clearly beyond the black cat shivering and moaning as to what is spreading the other open down below, but what you can see if the Sedan revving up every time the jaguar gets thrust down into the lap of its dominant partner. Obviously, someone has a big foot. Realizing that you won't be receiving any help here you decide to slowly back away out of the shop before any of the guys notice you and decide that you're a prime candidate to be initiated into the workforce. You never notice how many eyes are already on you, some of them looking rather hungrily in your direction as your asshole and elbows are moving like greased lightning away from the opened garage of the auto shop. Sarcastically you snort as the only thing getting [italic type]tuned[roman type] up in there is a bunch of guy's tailholes.";
