Roman by Kernog begins here.

"Adds the Team Captain Roman NPC, who hangs around Astroslide Football Field and is tied to the Tenvale Gorillas Football Team Quest."

Team Captain Roman is a man. Understand "Roman" as Team Captain Roman. "[first time]This is the captain of the Tenvale Gorillas. You hear some of the apes address him as 'captain Roman'. [only]Roman stands out from the rest of the players. He looks more mature, and in opposition to his teammates, who strut on the field with only a helmet and a shoulder-pad, he wears a tank-top and a pair of shorts, who outline his strong body.".
The conversation of Team Captain Roman is { "Yap!" }.
Team Captain Roman is in Astroslide Football Field.

instead of sniffing Team Captain Roman:
	say "     The scent of Roman's slightly sweaty fur reaches your nose. It's definitely a male smell, albeit not as strong as the other, more active gorillas.";

The discussion seems to switch back and forth between girls -and men-, and the best ways to fuck them, and many sportive anecdotes about him and the other players, both before and after the infection. He seems like an amicable, if slightly obnoxious, man.";

Roman welcomes you, before giving you a warm and breath-cutting hug. The large-and-in-charge primate makes small talk with you, giving news of every other member of team. 'Did you know that [one of]Bradley[or]Brian[or]Gavin[or]Nate[or]Andy[or]Ike[or]Vinny[or]Reid[or]Tom[or]Everett[at random] [one of]got himself a cheetah girl when he visited the zoo, the other day?[or]almost got molested by that goat janitor when he went to the hospital[or]scored himself one of these husky gals roaming the street?[or]got gangbanged by a gang of hyenas[or]found that neat bar; the Palomino, it was called.[or]tried to score one of these rats who hang around in the mall, but got rejected[or]almost ended up zipped up in a pooltoy, at the beach?[at random]";

'Fine, we can always use more members... but it's got to be the right people, you understand? We'll have another try-out in which you can and the other hopefuls can show their stuff. Come back sometime tomorrow and remind me that you want to [bold type]join[roman type], and you can have a go.' The gorilla pats your shoulder, then turns back to supervize the ongoing game.";

instead of fucking Team Captain Roman:
	say "     'Easy, tiger,' Roman chuckles. 'I am a little busy for the moment, but we'll definitely hook up in the near future, so check again another time.' ((Sex content will be added to Team Captain Roman at a later date. Stay tuned - Kernog)) ";

Roman ends here.
