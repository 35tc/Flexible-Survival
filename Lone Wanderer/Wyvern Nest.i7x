to say WyvernNestDesc:
	say "     You stand on a large, crudely constructed, nest-like structure. The outer part of the nest has been built out of several felled palm trees, here there are several vertical logs sticking out. Inbetween these pillars there are numerous other logs laid on top of each other approximating a circle pattern. Most of the stabilizing logs have been covered with a bit of white mucus, reminiscent of the wyverns' goop. On closer inspection you can see bite and claw marks on the trees that have been used to construct this huge home. The floor is vetted with lots of straw but also some more of the sticky wyvern secretions, not all of them being the sticky glue used to hold together this nest. Within this nest there are a couple of man-sized eggs, presumably victims of what is housing in this nest, their shells feeling hard on touch. On the straw floor you can discover a large assortment of items, most of which seems to be junk the nest's owner found on the beach. Maybe you can [italic type]search the wyvern nest[roman type] for something of use?";

Opposite there are prominent claw marks on this shell - it seems that the wyvern forced open a giant oyster to eat it and left some of its remains here. Picking it up, it does seem very sturdy and heavy, making the scene playing out in your head all the more impressive - this wyvern must have really powerful jaws and claws.

[Wyvern Nest specific items]
Table of Game Objects (continued)
name	desc	weight	object
"Half-Digested Mass"	"An amorphous mass of... something. You are not sure of its origins, the only thing you do know about this flesh-like pulp is that it was inside the belly of another beast. The thought of eating this repulses you."	1	Half-Digested Mass
"Seashell Shield"	"It's a shell of a giant oyster. While the creamy white shell has been chipped and scratched it does seem pretty sturdy."	2	Seashell Shield
"Torn Swim Trunks"	"A pair of swim trunks that have been ripped apart. You don't think it's going to offer much protection. In fact it's less protective than regular clothing as it leaves your crotch area open."	2	Torn Swim Trunks

	else:
		say "Briefly pondering with the raw meat in your hands, you examine its texture, it being a bit discoloured of being attacked by the previous eaters['] enzymes and acids. That and the smell are enough to convince you to stash it away; you are not eating this.";
		increase carried of Half-Digested Mass by 1;	[Increase count of half-digested mass by 1; You don't use it after all]

instead of sniffing Half-Digested Mass:
	say "Taking the soft and unidentified mass into your hand, you take a whiff. You regret your decision with its acrid and acidic odour punishing your sense of smell. Hastily packing the slushy pile away, you cough and gasp for more fresh air, trying to get the pungent taste out of your nostrils; in the meantime you wonder why you even carry around this piece of garbage.";

Seashell Shield is equipment.
It is not temporary.

Torn Swim Trunks is equipment.

	say "     You face the wyvern and speak to it, [one of]asking it for its name[or]introducing yourself[or]asking whether it is hungry[or]asking whether it can talk[or]asking whether you may borrow some equipment[at random]. The wyvern tilts its head, yellow eyes with slitted pupils pinned on your form in a blank, animal-like stare. The nest guardian probably didn't understand you, but it still tries to discern why you are meaningfully standing in front of it. Before it gets any ideas to do anything else to you, you move to another spot in the nest, pretending to be busy with something else. Thankfully, this seems to be enough to make it lose interest as the wyvern moves its long neck to groom the scales on its back.";
	
instead of fucking the Wyvern Patriarch:

This serene place could make one forget for a moment about the fact that this beach is haunted by creatures that people would find unbelievable just a few weeks ago. This moment of reflection is interrupted as you notice a footmark on the dry sand; a footprint of the paw of a three-clawed creature. Before you can make any guesses, you notice a shadow creeping up from behind. Recognizing the shadow as one of the wyvern creatures from the city, you barely dodge its goop that it tried to entrap you with.

[Referencing the functions in the table doesn't exactly work, as Inform always wants table entries to have a type. So maybe I have to search for a function that converts a string to a function]
[Acquiring the seashell or half-digested meat break the game currently. I don't know why. It was because wn_diceroll didn't keep its number for some reason. Now I'm using diceroll as a middle man and save its value in wn_diceroll]
[I'd like to use search wyvern nest as the command; it works now]

Wyvern Nest ends here.
