	try looking;
	say "     Walking into the maintenance storeroom that now serves as your bedroom, the bed calls to you as the door closes, the stress of the day catching up to you. Tossing your bag onto the ground, you nearly collapse onto the small cot that now serves as your bed. Laying there and looking up at the ceiling, you start to feel the need for sleep almost like a heavy pressure behind your eyes. Listening to the familiar sounds of the library, you can make out someone softly having a conversation from above and a hard thud from outside your door, more than likely Brutus taking his place guarding you while you slumber. As your eyes begin to burn with the need to rest, you close them in an attempt to help hydrate them, however once you open them again, your vision is blurry, and you have to blink a few times to get your eyes to adjust. You quickly realize that something is wrong and sit up while looking around, The room was never very colorful to begin with, but now everything appears to be in shades of white, black, and gray, almost like one of those old-fashioned movies.";
	say "     Standing up from the cot, a lightheadedness sweeps through your mind causing you to grab onto one of the nearby shelves, and you wait for your equilibrium to finally settle. Once you feel alright to move, you begin to make your way for the door, each step feeling like gravity is pressing your body harder into the ground with much more intensity than it should. Finally at the door, you wrench it open, fully expecting to be met with Brutus's massive form, but instead you only see swirling black smoke beginning to creep through the open doorway. While investigating the anomaly, you stop just before the tendrils of smoke can make contact with your body. Contemplating on what to do next, you turn your head slowly and look behind you at the small storeroom. You notice that while its appearance may have changed, it's still somewhere that you've marked as your own, and it still has that air of safety to it.";
	LineBreak;
	say "     [bold type]Do you want to lay back down in the safety of your cot?[roman type][line break]";
	say "     ([link]Y[as]y[end link]) - Yes, this has to be a dream and you need to wake up.";

	if Player consents: [This will eliminate the Master of Mell quest from continuing]
		LineBreak;
		say "     Taking a single step away from the swirling darkness, you turn around and make your way back to the small cot. Laying your head down on the small pillow, you close your eyes and do your best to focus on trying to wake up. Your own personal scent surrounds you but underneath that you can make out the smell of both Brutus and Skarnoth. Slowing your breathing and allowing your mind to go back to that moment the three of you shared, a strange static sound starts to build from within your mind until finally it becomes almost painful and jolts you completely upright in shock. Glancing around, you realize that the colors are back to normal, and in your attempt to get up, you almost fall off the cot. Rushing to the door and wrenching it open, you almost run right into Brutus's firm back and quickly wrap your arms around the demon brute as he turns around to face you. Finally pulling back, you happily inform him how grateful you are to see him. The only response you are met with is a single raised eyebrow, followed by a look of confusion.";
		say "     'Why can't I reach into your mind, [master]? Have you finally learned how to keep others out?' Confused yourself, you just stare at Brutus with your mouth hanging open, that is until you notice something different about his throat... Your bite mark is gone. The brute's face quickly clouds over with something akin to fear, the facial expression looking alien and out of place on your dark knight's visage. A ear-splitting roar bursts from Brutus's mouth, causing you to take a reflexive step back. Before you're able to ask him what's wrong, he interrupts you, 'What did you do?! My whole body feels like it's on fire again! You promised that the pain would end!' You don't know what to say, your jaw hanging open as you think of how to respond. 'You are liar!' Watching as the demon attempts to formulate his words, it's almost like the pain is too great for him to focus. 'You're not [master], you prey!'";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     A clawed hand swipes down at your face, but before you're able to duck down, it stops just short of colliding. The look of rage and betrayal never wavers from the demon brute's intense gaze. 'I... will... destroy... you!' With one final roar, Brutus bursts into a cloud of purple smoke and is sucked back into the pendant that you had promised that he would never have to return to. Trying to make sense of what exactly just happened, you're once again pulled from your thoughts as Skarnoth rushes down the stairs of the bunker. '[Master], what was that sound?! It sounded like Brutus was shouting about something.' Opening your mouth to explain what just happened, it quickly snaps shut as your eyes lock onto the royal incubus's throat... His mark is gone as well. '[Master], what's wrong? You don't look so good.' A strange flash washes over Skarnoth's face, just like it did with Brutus, causing his eyes to roll into the back of his head briefly. 'I... don't feel very well, [master].'";
		say "     The demon slumps to the floor and ragged breaths start to escape his chest. Remembering what happened with Brutus and how whatever gift that was passed onto him must have reverted somehow, you quickly leap into action and reach out to help the formal royal to his feet. Doing your best, you attempt to get the demon up the stairs of the bunker and back to his chair as fast as possible. Once he's seated, his breathing finally begins to return to normal, although he still appears slightly out of it. Not knowing what else to do, you start to explain to Skarnoth what had happened with Brutus and then to himself. 'Wait, Brutus? You mean that drooling beast that you enslaved?' You gape slightly and then proceed to ask why he would say that about someone that he apparently was able to form a bond of brotherhood with. 'A bond of brotherhood? You must be joking, [master]. I've never even talked with that animal.' It's almost as if the submissive demon somehow forgot everything that took place after you began to place those bite marks the hellspawn in your possession.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     While processing what all of this could mean, a voice calls out from behind you, 'Is everything alright?' It's Elijah, his expression warm while meeting your gaze, but quickly turns cold as he takes in Skarnoth. 'You had best be staying out of trouble, demon, because if I find out otherwise, I will put you down before you can do any further damage.' The exhausted incubus merely mocks the angel and waves him off. Just as it looks as if Elijah's about to retaliate, you step in and explain to the angel that everything is fine and that you were simply checking in on him. With a shake of his head, the divine being's only response is, 'Don't pay these demons any mind. Remember that they are nothing but monsters, incapable of actually feeling anything other than the desire to destroy everything that they can.' With that, the angel gives you a slight smile and exits the room, leaving you to wonder if what Elijah said is true. A darker thought is quick to follow. If that's true then what does that make you, someone who gave them hope and a possible reason to feel, only to somehow rip it all away and erase those moments...";

		say "     Steeling your nerves, you take a confident step forward, allowing the shadows to twist and wrap around your body, caressing your form. However, the further you walk into the seemingly endless darkness, the tighter the grip of the tendrils become, feeling almost as if they are attempting to halt your progress. After what feel like hours of walking, you finally are able to make out a light further ahead and using all of your strength, you push on, finally freeing yourself from the shadow tentacles that have slithered around your form. As you finally burst free, your eyes are hit with the dim light of the room, causing a grunt of pain to escape your lips. Bringing your hand up to offer them shelter from the brightness, you try to allow them to adjust to the contrast in light. Once you're able to look around without your eyes stinging, you can see that you're standing on what appears to be a strange plateau surrounded by swirling smoke. Turning back, you notice that the doorway that you came through has somehow vanished into thin air.";
		say "     Looking out across the vast emptiness, you can't help but wonder if passing through that door was the right choice. A slight tingle starts at the base of your skull and progressively makes its way down the rest of your spine. It's a familiar feeling, almost as if you're being watched. Whirling around in an attempt to catch whatever was spying on you, you're met with a haunting chuckle, well if you can even call it that, the sound being somewhere between the sound of a lunatic's ravings mixed with the sound of a wounded animal screeching. What you're met with is a semi-transparent shadow. At first, you aren't sure what to make of this discovery. While it's shocking to see a sentient shade, your time in the city has also taught you to pay attention to your surroundings. Looking closer at it, there is no way to figure out what exactly it's supposed to be a shadow of or if this thing even has a gender. A mouth forms on what you can only assume must be the shade's face, sharp, jagged teeth protruding outward from the freshly formed orifice.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     Two bright-yellow orbs begin to travel up the being's form, passing by the long tentacles of darkness all around its body, eventually becoming lifeless-looking eyes that wobble back and forth, making this thing appear even more unsettling. The creature smiles at you, something that may have been intended to put you at ease, however it causes quite the opposite, and you enter a defensive position instead. 'Haha, well that's certainly rude, don't you think? Here I am, trying to help you be more comfortable and what's my thanks? You act as if you're going to attack me, buhaha.' The being looks absolutely giddy by your actions, meaning it either wants a fight, or it views your antics as hardly a threat and silly.";

'I see that your arrogance is certainly something to be admired, especially considering the fact that you have no idea who or what I am... or what I may be capable of, and still you think that you can just pummel me into submission.' The being rises higher off the ground, dark tendrils emerging from the base of its form, each with their own private mouths that seemingly propel the creature's movement. Before you can react, the tentacled shadow begins to circle around you, maniacal laughter coming from every angle. While it's hard to focus on the beast itself, what with all of that shrieking piercing your ears, you finally thrust a fist outward and it appears to connect with... nothing. Your hand simply moved through the shades body, 'There, see? Wasn't that a fun little game to play? It's always fun to make new friends, don't you think?' Returning to its original spot, the shade continues to speak, 'As you can plainly see, I can't be touched. I am a being of the void. Think of it as a place that exists between the dream world and the real one.'";
			say "     Long clawed hands creep up from the being's side and cover its mouth as it continues to giggle. 'More power will be needed before you can beat anything into submission, little [master].' The term [master] catches you off guard, your thoughts instantly turning to both Skarnoth and Brutus. The two of them have both been using that term a lot recently. You are pulled from your thoughts by a deep guttural rumble. 'This goes deeper than your little pets. They are merely tools to achieve an even greater ambition, well if you're strong enough to claim it that is.' Knowing full well that the names of your demons, or even their existence, never passed from your lips, you raise an eyebrow at the shade. The only reply that you're given is simply more cackling.";

'I see that you're smart enough to realize when you are out of your element, especially considering that you have no idea who or what I am.... or what I may be capable of.' The being rises higher off the ground, dark tendrils emerging from the base of its form, each with their own private mouths that seemingly propel the creature's movement. Before you can react, the tentacled shadow begins to circle around you, maniacal laughter coming from every angle.

		say "     A slimy purple tongue emerges from between serrated teeth, licking the thing's non-existent lips. 'The truth is, while dreams are tasty, each filled with the hopes of mortals, nightmares are far more... delicious. All that fear, the adrenaline just under the surface, screaming to break free...' A vile-looking white mucus begins to drip from the shade's mouth. 'But I digress. Right now, we shouldn't be talking about my feeding habits, instead we should be discussing a potential symbiotic relationship that could be formed.' The disbelief has to be evident on your face. The way this creature jumps from topic to topic seems to have no real reason to it, almost as if it were purposefully attempting to be confusing. For the first time, the shade actually appears as if it's becoming frustrated. 'I suppose that since [']I['] already know the score, I never really expected that I would have to explain myself properly. How tedious. Well, even I can admit when I should be helping a lesser being to understand what should be obvious.'";
		say "     Finally finding your voice, you ask the creature for its name. 'Name?' The shade quickly looks down at one of its tentacles and half whispers in anger, 'No, not your name! The liberator asked my [']name['], you fool... No, I already told you that you can watch, but no touching!' Taking a step backwards, you can't be sure whether this thing is simply crazed, or if there is something else here that you simply can't see. Your movement however pulls the creature's attention. 'Ah yes, a name. Well I don't particularly like the idea of names. They are simply a method of control. You see, knowledge is power, and I don't much care for the thought of anyone having that sort of power over me. However, perhaps a different type of transaction can be made, hmm?' The whining sound that it ended its question with sends a chill down your spine, along with the fact that apparently this thing thinks that you're some kind of liberator.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     The shade either doesn't notice, or simply doesn't care about the effect that it is having on you. 'Now, what could I offer you?' The way that the shadow talks makes it sound as if it already knows [']exactly['] what it plans on saying. 'This place is my own personal creation, somewhere that has a pull all of its own. You see, when mortals close their eyes, enter dreamland, and are full of intense emotions, their essence can find its way here.' Looking around at the vacant area, you aren't sure that you're able to hide how unimpressed you are by the place's appearance. 'Well what do you think of this space? I'm sure that it's a little bland by mortal standards, but maybe something could be done about that. If you could have a domain of your very own, what sort of residents would you enjoy watching?";
		say "     Silence fills the air between the two of you, as you're not really sure what they mean or how you should answer them. 'What I mean is that if I were to simply give you this realm, purely as an example mind you, what sort of dreamers would you want to see visit?' The condescending tone of the shade's voice causes your hackles to raise. 'I mean in simple terms, would someone like you prefer a world filled with beautiful females? Perhaps a paradise of manliness and testosterone? Or maybe you're someone that can find the pleasure in a little bit of everything, hmm?' A shudder goes through you before all of what the creature said sinks in. A world of your own choosing?";

		say "     'I see, so that's the sort of thing that you're into? What a naughty little [master] you must be, hehe. Truth be told, I suppose I could see how adding a bit of [']flavor['] could help this place be less boring for a mortal.' A feeling of embarrassment washes over you at the idea that you actually played into this thing's game, but the shadow doesn't seem to be judging your choices, instead finding the whole situation more amusing than anything. Growing tired of the games that this creature is playing, you quickly shout at the shade to get to the point, demanding to know exactly why you're here! 'Tut-tut, that's a rather rude way to ask a question, don't you think? Besides, why should I tell you... when I can simply show you!' With lightning speed, the creature rushes at you, however rather than the impact that you're expecting, it fades into your body instead.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     A shrieking laugh fills your head until it is the only thing that you can focus on, causing you to become dizzy, and you drop to your knees with nausea. Shaking your head and taking a few deep breaths, you stand up and brace yourself for whatever trick that shadow has planned. A light behind you catches your attention. Spinning around, you are met with a very familiar sight, although you have never seen it quite from [']this['] perspective. Looking forward, you can see a battlefield frozen in time. Both you and Skarnoth are in the heat of battle, grimaced mouths shouting out in silent rage. From inside your head, a voice vibrates through your skull 'I see that you remember this battle. The moment that you chose to get involved in things that were not your concern, and in doing so, decided the fate of this city... and perhaps much more.' Glancing at Skarnoth, it's almost like looking at someone totally different than the demon you've become used too. 'The demon prince was well on his way to claiming your realm. He had amassed his entire army in preparation.'";
		say "     The image hardens into ash, only to crumble and  reform with the scene of you clasping the slave collar around the former royal demon's throat. 'The way leadership works in Hell is that when one master falls, the next in the bloodline absorbs the discarded energy and is able to take the throne. However, by sparing and enslaving him instead, you trapped his power.' Everything around you fades to black, until a scene unfolds: a huge hall filled with more demons than you can count. They all appear to be cheering and celebrating, however at the far back of the room is a large throne. A demon that looks surprising like Skarnoth is slumped over the side and judging by the wound to his throat, he's already dead. 'So now there are leaderless demons raging against the barrier to your realm and an empty throne that your pet's younger sibling could never properly fill.' Hearing that Skarnoth has a little brother shocks you since the last time you talked on the subject, he claimed that demons didn't have any brothers, but then again perhaps he didn't even know. Taking a deep breath at the thought of having to tell Skarnoth about his brother, you realize that you can't seem to suck in any oxygen.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     Hacking and coughing, black smoke starts to pour out of every orifice that you have, centering in a single spot until it coalesces into the shade's original form 'So now you know the truth. The demons will break the barrier and swarm the city. Left unchecked, they will spread like a plague across your world... and it's all your fault, haha.' Without thinking, you rush at the shadow, your fist already pulled back and ready to strike. A single clawed hand rises, causing your entire body to freeze in place. 'You really are going to learn how to keep that rage in check, besides there is one other option. You see, fate had already decreed that the current Master of Hell would have won, or that he would have been killed by a being of light. You know what that means, right?' Your mind starts trying to piece the information together. Basically, what this thing is saying is that someone should have died, either Skarnoth or Elijah.";
		say "     'This is why I hate mortals. They always think about [']people['] rather than the big picture... You! You were not part of fate's design and thus you changed it!' Turning to the side, the shade once again mutters something to someone that you can't see. 'I know, I know, it can't help that it's a lower life form.' The creature finally calms down again and turns back to address you. 'Let me try to explain. Let's say that fate is a riddle, alright? The riddle is something like, what walks on four legs in the morning, two during the day, and three at night? Any normal person would answer that it's obviously the victim of a killer that is adding and removing parts for fun, but you might answer something ridiculous, like the life stages of a human being. That's what you are: an anomaly that makes no sense!' Personally, you think the shadow's answer is the more idiotic one, but you don't say anything, instead waiting for it to continue.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     'I'm sure that you have noticed certain marks appearing on your pets, almost like a brand? Well that's your personal mark. By breaking the former Master of Hell, you've somehow inherited a part of his power. I brought you here to guide you in how to help it grow.' Finally you open your mouth to speak, the question on your tongue being why you would want their help, or better yet why they would want to help you. 'Oh, that's simple, either your power grows, or the beings that you seem to care so much about, yourself included, will be destroyed. As to your other question... I'm just a helpful sort of demon, that's all, haha!' The comment is made so simply, as if the creature is commenting on nothing more than the weather. 'Oh come now. If anything, you should be thrilled that I'm saying there is a shred of hope, hehe! Then again, saying a shred is still overselling your abilities by a great deal.' The warped smile on the being's face makes you want nothing more than to bash in each and every tooth.";
		say "     'The first act of generosity on my part is that I will give you this space for your own personal use, well as long as you understand that I will still be feeding from your pool.' You ask what they mean exactly by [']feeding[']? 'Only their energy. They may wake a little more tired than usual, but will be otherwise unaffected. Now, what was the next question I had planned?' The ground erupts as a huge stone monolith rises up with something already written on its surface. Taking a closer look, you can make out the roman numeral for one and next to that is the list of genders you seem to be interested in. 'Ah yes, well I know that you mortals are suckers for a good theme, so why don't we choose one for this little dark sanctum of yours, haha. Be warned though, only one can be chosen, well for now at least. These things take up a lot of energy to maintain, and you will need to amass much more energy to gain more. Before you start asking questions, yes, I can do anything within this space, regardless of the genders that you desire.'";

The shade turns its attention back towards the monolith, its long clawed fingers clicking together in a contemplative manner as it seems to be analyzing the huge stone tablet. 'Hmm, there are only two other topics that are in need of immediate attention. The first is a power base: you are going to need somewhere to build up your strength, somewhere with a natural connection to darkness.' Opening your mouth to speak, you comment on the fact that there is a burnt out church nearby that already has demons dwelling within. 'No, that simply won't do. Remember that this path will lead to you gaining many new enemies, and as such, you will need a much more defensive position. Lucky for you, I have already found the perfect location!' The creature's excitement puts your nerves on edge, but just the same, you ask the shadow to continue.";
	say "     'It just so happens that a huge demonic relic has arrived in the east part of the city, an ancient citadel that is the very incarnation of evil. It must have risen out of Hell from underneath the lava beds there. A word of warning though, it did not arrive alone... It would seem that a few demons must have been attempting to ride it as a means to breach your realm.' Rolling your eyes, you ask the shade if they are expecting you to fight your way through an army of demons to claim this relic? 'Well of course, but like all things in this world, it shall be easier said than done. The demons that [']were['] inhabiting the citadel well... they're all dead. Which is great news for you, however something much more dangerous has decided to claim the building for itself.' The shade comes closer and wraps its arm around you, and an extreme feeling of nausea floods throughout your stomach.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     The creature quickly pulls its hand back and retreats a bit further away. 'Sorry about that, little [master]. I always forget that mortals don't do well with my touch. Anyways, as I was saying, there are many different types of hells, each with their own unique outlook on the world of mortals. The beast that has claimed our citadel is from one such place. His name is Shuten Dōji, an oni of considerable power. Thankfully for you though, his name says it all as he is quite the drunkard. You will have to approach this enemy with slightly different methods than you're probably used too. The truth is that this beast can't be outright killed... well it can, but he would simply pop right back up. Trust me, he's been killed before and that didn't stop him in the slightest. Also something to keep in mind is that he will be guarded by his troops of fellow oni and kijo, so don't underestimate this endeavor.'";
	say "     Rising high up into the air, the shade begins to explain the next aspect of what you will need for victory. 'Besides claiming the citadel, you will be needing to... acquire five very important allies to our cause. The first two are already in your possession, that brute and his former master will do nicely, however you will also need to find another [']natural['] demon. That should be your first goal since they will most likely prove useful in taking the relic. Afterwards though, we will need two demons that were born human, so keep an eye out on your travels. You will also have to force ascension onto the five at some point. Think of it as a form of... demonic evolution that will increase their power. To do this, you will need to share your strength with them, either by blood or sexual fluids, your choice. As each one awakens, they will become your lords of Hell, an essential piece of the puzzle.' Gliding down, the shade floats right in front of your face 'So, what do you think? Do we have a deal?' Somehow, everything about this question, makes it feel as if this is a moment that you will never be able to take back.";

Once the shadow calms down a bit, it stops and tilts its head down towards one of the mouthed tentacles. Even though it is whispering, you are still able to make out what is being said. 'Yes, of course I remember, but I wanted to make sure that the mortal was willing to play the role intended for them.' Straightening back up, the shade looks directly at you, its normally wobbly eyes now completely still. 'I have been watching you for a while now, and I have seen the way you deal with situations. To be honest, it leaves much to be desired, so I have one final question for you. If you are able to claim the mantle of Master of Hell, what type of master do you think that you will become?'";

You miserable little insect! I offer you power, the ability to forge a new world and this is my thanks!? Consider yourself lucky that I don't simply trap you here and allow your physical body to rot and die!' With that, you are flung backwards into the darkness, the feeling of tentacles all around you, their harsh grip making it hard to breathe. A strange static sound starts to build from within your mind until it finally becomes almost painful and jolts you completely upright in shock. Glancing around, you realize that the colors are back to normal, and in your attempt to get up, you almost fall off the cot. Rushing to the door and wrenching it open, you almost run right into Brutus's firm back and quickly wrap your arms around the demon brute as he turns around to face you. Finally pulling back, you happily inform him how grateful you are to see him, but the only response you are met with is a single raised eyebrow followed by a look of confusion.";
		say "     'Why can't I reach into your mind, [master]? Have you finally learned how to keep others out?' Confused yourself, you just stare at Brutus with your mouth hanging open, that is until you notice something different about his throat... Your bite mark is gone. The brute's face quickly clouds over with something akin to fear, the facial expression looking alien and out of place on your dark knight's visage. A ear-splitting roar bursts from Brutus's mouth, causing you to take a reflexive step back. Before you're able to ask him what's wrong, he interrupts you, 'What did you do?! My whole body feels like it's on fire again! You promised that the pain would end!' You don't know what to say, your jaw hanging open as you think of how to respond. 'You are liar!' Watching as the demon attempts to formulate his words, it's almost like the pain is too great for him to focus. 'You're not [master], you prey!'";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     A clawed hand swipes down at your face, but before you're able to duck down, it stops just short of colliding. The look of rage and betrayal never wavers from the demon brute's intense gaze. 'I... will... destroy... you!' With one final roar, Brutus bursts into a cloud of purple smoke and is sucked back into the pendant that you had promised that he would never have to return to. Trying to make sense of what exactly just happened, you're once again pulled from your thoughts as Skarnoth rushes down the stairs of the bunker. '[Master], what was that sound?! It sounded like Brutus was shouting about something.' Opening your mouth to explain what just happened, it quickly snaps shut as your eyes lock onto the royal incubus's throat... His mark is gone as well. '[Master], what's wrong? You don't look so good.' A strange flash washes over Skarnoth's face, just like it did with Brutus, causing his eyes to roll into the back of his head briefly. 'I... don't feel very well, [master].'";
		say "     The demon slumps to the floor and ragged breaths start to escape his chest. Remembering what happened with Brutus and how whatever gift that was passed onto him must have reverted somehow, you quickly leap into action and reach out to help the formal royal to his feet. Doing your best, you attempt to get the demon up the stairs of the bunker and back to his chair as fast as possible. Once he's seated, his breathing finally begins to return to normal, although he still appears slightly out of it. Not knowing what else to do, you start to explain to Skarnoth what had happened with Brutus and then to himself. 'Wait, Brutus? You mean that drooling beast that you enslaved?' You gape slightly and then proceed to ask why he would say that about someone that he apparently was able to form a bond of brotherhood with. 'A bond of brotherhood? You must be joking, [master]. I've never even talked with that animal.' It's almost as if the submissive demon somehow forgot everything that took place after you began to place those bite marks the hellspawn in your possession.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     While processing what all of this could mean, a voice calls out from behind you, 'Is everything alright?' It's Elijah, his expression warm while meeting your gaze, but quickly turns cold as he takes in Skarnoth. 'You had best be staying out of trouble, demon, because if I find out otherwise, I will put you down before you can do any further damage.' The exhausted incubus merely mocks the angel and waves him off. Just as it looks as if Elijah's about to retaliate, you step in and explain to the angel that everything is fine and that you were simply checking in on him. With a shake of his head, the divine being's only response is, 'Don't pay these demons any mind. Remember that they are nothing but monsters, incapable of actually feeling anything other than the desire to destroy everything that they can.' With that, the angel gives you a slight smile and exits the room, leaving you to wonder if what Elijah said is true. A darker thought is quick to follow. If that's true then what does that make you, someone who gave them hope and a possible reason to feel, only to somehow rip it all away and erase those moments...";

'Hmmm, well that's all well and good, but before that can become a reality, you might need a little... push in the right direction!' With those words, the shadow smiles as a dark cloud begins to pour from within its maw. Even though you try to force your body to move, you stay rooted to the spot as the fog surrounds your form. As it swirls around you, it begins to lift your body off the ground and seems to be focusing in on your face. You attempt to struggle against the invisible force restraining you, but even then, the particles of darkness begin to seep into every orifice you have.

While you may have meant every word, the sound was slightly off, almost as if it were infused with something... extra. The shade seems to find your reaction amusing at the least, well if its cackling is to be trusted. 'Buhahaha, what did you think that evil was just something that happened? While yes, you did technically decide to follow the path of evil, all Masters of Hell must receive a small infusion of the original Heart of Darkness!

You did mention something about a burned up church if memory serves, but don't worry, we will have much more to discuss later, after you have adapted to the darkness within you a bit more.' With that, the shade gives you a final maniacal smile, and with its boney hand opening up and facing you, you're immediately slammed backwards.

With my powers gone, I will be viewed as prey for the other hellspawn that are still left in the city!'
