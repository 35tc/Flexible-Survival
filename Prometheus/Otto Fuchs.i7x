While not fat, his body shape suggests that he doesn't exercise regularly and enjoys his food, a habit that you wonder how he has managed to maintain in the apocalypse. He is dressed in a white shirt with black trousers that are held up by red suspenders. He has a kind, crinkly face with soft-brown eyes that look at you from behind round, silver spectacles as you examine him. When he speaks, it is with a German accent. Around his neck, in a stereotypical fashion, is a stethoscope.";
			say "     Dr. Fuchs is a strong willed and stubborn man, confident in his methods and medical capabilities. He is very concerned with acting with morality, as shown by the magnitude of which he keeps his Hippocratic Oath, and treats all who come to him whether they are transformed or human. Though cynical of how those in power may try and use recent events to their advantage, he seems to sympathise with the soldiers sent into the city. His mentality seems to contrast with many of the other medical professionals.";

You imagine that he still enjoys food as much as he used to though. Somehow, he seems to have found a tailor to alter his clothes to fit his new body, wearing a white shirt and black trousers with a belt. He has a shrewd face, though he has maintained his kindly soft-brown eyes, which he looks at you from behind round, silver spectacles that have been adapted for his new face as you examine him. When he speaks, it is with a German accent. Around his neck, in a stereotypical fashion, is a stethoscope, which he frequently brushes lovingly with his fluffy tail.";
			say "     Dr. Fuchs is a strong-willed and cunning fox, confident in his methods and medical capabilities. While mostly concerned with acting with morality, he is willing to pressure some patients for what he feels is for their benefit, and he seems to be correct each time. His Hippocratic Oath is still an important cornerstone of his personality, caring for both the transformed and the human. Though cynical of how those in power may try and use recent events to their advantage, he seems to sympathise with the soldiers sent into the city. His mentality seems to contrast with many of the other medical professionals.";

He still enjoys food as much as he used to, holding his paws to his mouth in an adorable manner as he eats. His clothes have been tailored to fit his new body, still consisting of a white shirt and black trousers with a belt. They also seem to have been waterproofed. He has a cute whiskery face, with soft-brown eyes that look at you through prescription, corrective goggles as you examine him. When he speaks, it is with a German accent. Around his neck, in a stereotypical fashion, is a stethoscope. His thick otter tail swings around behind him, counterbalancing his movements.";
			say "     Dr. Fuchs is a strong-willed and inquisitive otter, confident in his methods and medical capabilities. While mostly concerned with acting with morality, he is willing to try new things at the patient's request if they can justify it.

	say "     While exploring, you hear a burst of gunfire over the usual noises of the city. It doesn't sound far off, and you decide to investigate further. As you round the corner, you see an anthro rabbit lying on the pavement, holding his shoulder as blood seeps between his fingers. Standing a few feet away from him, rifle still raised, is a soldier who seems to have been separated from his group. 'You shot me. Why?' the lagomorph questions the brooding soldier, his grey fur progressively staining. Across the street, a door slams open, and a short, smartly-dressed man hurries over with a satchel grasped in one hand, distracting the soldier before he can answer. He looks like he is about to fire, but when he catches sight of you approaching as well, his aim twitches around, unsure what to do. You raise your hands as you approach, showing that you have no ill intent and tell him that you heard some shots and were curious what had happened. By this time, the other human has reached the rabbit, dropping to a crouch and opening his bag to reveal a basic first aid kit and pulling on a pair of surgical gloves.";
	say "     'What happened?' the older man asks authoritatively as he pulls the rabbit's hand away from the shoulder and swabs the wound. 'He shot me as I came out of my home,' the leporine cries, hissing as the swab rubs over the wound. 'Lower the gun, young man. You are going to cause trouble if you are not careful. Trust me, I am a doctor.' The German accent might have been considered novel were it not for the appearance that he is an uninfected human living within the city. The soldier seems to ignore the suggestion, training the rifle on the doctor as he treats the injured rabbit. Sighing, the older man stops cleaning the wound and turns to face the scared soldier. 'You are pointing a gun at a medical professional as they attempt to treat a patient. Now, I will not fight back should you decide to shoot. I have taken a Hippocratic Oath. I am not allowed to attack you, but I have helped a few people around here. I do not judge by species. After all, change allows progress. The help that I give the community means that many of them are quite fond of me.'";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     'This fondness means that should you kill me, and you could do so fairly easily as I do not heal as well as so many of the transformed, there would literally be a mob of angry bears and wolves that would not let you leave in the same state as you are now.' The lecture seems to have some effect on the soldier, as he lowers his weapon but maintains a watch over you all as the doctor begins to stitch the wound closed. 'I do not believe that you have answered why you shot the rabbit yet. Care to explain?' the older man asks. 'He gave me a fright coming out of the door, and I thought that I was about to be attacked,' the soldier replies sullenly. 'I can understand the cordon, but why the military has to send troops wandering around the city I don't understand,' the rabbit comments groggily. The young man snaps, 'None of your business, freak.' The glare he receives from the doctor could freeze a phoenix. 'Leave. Now.' The amount of disgust in those two words drives the soldier to obey immediately.";
	say "     As he leaves, you approach the patient and his healer, asking whether you can be of assistance. The doctor gives you a brief smile, saying, 'I can understand why you did not get closer before, but the difficult bit is past. Now, his body should fix itself. But we should not leave him in the street. Let us take him into my home while he recovers. Ah, but where are my manners? My name is Otto Fuchs. I am a medical doctor, if you still respect the profession after seeing the state of the hospital.' You have to admit, he does seem to be less... sex-crazed than the staff there. 'Can you walk, young sir?' he asks the rabbit, helping him to stand. The leporine doesn't bother to answer, instead refusing the aid and standing alone before taking a few confidant steps. 'He shot me in the shoulder, not the leg, doc, but thank you. I should be alright now,' he says cheerfully, especially for someone recovering from a gunshot wound.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     'Suit yourself,' Otto grunts, carefully removing his gloves and stuffing them into a plastic bag. The rabbit walks back up the steps to his home, rolling his shoulder to make sure there isn't any permanent damage. Unsurprisingly, like most of the other infected, his ability to recover from harm seems to be phenomenal and from looking at him, you wouldn't believe he had been shot several minutes ago. As he opens the door, he waves and calls out thanks to you both. You turn back to Dr. Fuchs as he finishes closing his bag and straightens up again. 'I appreciate the concern that you showed for that young man. Many might have run the opposite direction, so thank you. I would say that I hope to see you again, but you might not want to hear that from a doctor,' he says with a chuckle. 'So instead, I shall wish you well and hope to see you under fairer circumstances.' With that, he trudges back across the road and enters his own apartment. As you leave the area, you thank your lucky stars that there are still sane doctors in the city.";

	say "     As you exit from an alley, you realise that you are back on the same street you saw the German doctor. In front of you is the building in which the rabbit person resides. Your observations are interrupted by a figure staggering down the street clutching his side. You simultaneously realise that it is the same soldier as last time, and that there is an unhealthy amount of blood staining his uniform and trickling through his fingers. He reaches the road just opposite you, before crumpling to the ground, supporting himself with one arm while his other hand continues to staunch the bleeding. You are just deciding whether or not to get help when a rather well-dressed toad hurls open a door of one of the houses and rushes out. You step out of the shadows of the alleyway and see them run across to the doctor's home, their legs not suited to such movement. 'Dr. Fuchs, you're needed out here! It's an emergency! There is a severely wounded soldier collapsed in the street!' the amphibian shouts, pummeling his fist against the door.";
	say "     A few moments later, the middle-aged doctor opens the door and calls behind him, 'Bring the [‘]O-[‘] with you, Genevieve, and if you think that I've forgotten anything, bring that too.' Otto walks briskly towards the collapsed man, a large bag under one arm. He drops to a crouch beside the soldier and pulls a bottle of ethanol and some scissors from a pocket of the bag. Pulling on some rubber gloves, he gently positions the groaning soldier on his back, knees bent. Carefully cutting the shirt away, Dr. Fuchs exposes the wound to the eyes of all onlookers. Brutal tears have shredded the left side of his abdomen, and you are surprised he got this far. You approach, ready to offer any assistance that he might need. Otto looks up as you approach, a grim expression on his face. 'I have my assistant with me today, and I think that this might be a bit too specialised for you anyway,' he says before you can even ask. Deciding that giving him space to work may be the best that you can do, you back off, but continue to watch curiously, the spectacle drawing residents from their homes.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     As if on cue, a vixen with fur the colour of obsidian trots out of the house, a medical satchel over one shoulder and carrying a bowl of boiling water. Setting it down next to Dr. Fuchs, she addresses him, 'I brought this so that you could make sure that the equipment is still sterile.' He gives her a grateful smile as he places some scissors, forceps, and a small container of needles into the bubbling liquid. A few more residents have come out of their homes to see what the commotion is about. Dipping a cloth in the boiling water, Otto begins to wipe the wound, the soldier wincing and grunting in pain. 'Are you able to tell me what happened, young man? There is considerable damage, and yet you are neither mutating or healing,' the doctor softly asks his patient as he tends to him. The soldier seems about to answer when another voice does so before him.";
	say "     'He was in our turf, and we don't take kindly to the army sticking their nose where it isn't wanted,' a deep growly voice replies. You turn to see three hyenas wearing dirty leather approaching, wet blood dripping from their leader’s arms. On his right hand, he wears a glove with sharpened metal attached, presumably the cause of the soldier's wounds. Such brutality causes a gasp from some of the people watching, a few returning inside fearfully. 'So if you could hand him back to us, I'll finish what I started,' the lead hyena continues, his cronies nodding menacingly and glaring at the remaining residents as if to say [']leave if you don't want any trouble[']. The black fox kneels down to take over the human's care as Otto stands up and faces the gang. 'I'm afraid that I can't do that. He is my patient now, so I must do all in my power to heal him,' he says repugnantly, the gang leader baring his teeth at this response.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Perhaps concerned about the doctor's safety when violence seems second nature to the hyena group before him, several larger beasts - an imposing tiger, a tattered-looking wolf, and a [']grinning['] crocodile - advance until they are flanking him and ensuring his protection. The hyenas seem to be gauging their chances of punishing Fuchs for his insolence until the wolf lets out a howl. The piercing cry seems to echo around the street and you would imagine through the city. A replying howl confirms your suspicions and seems to be a turning point for the gang of feliforms. 'This isn't over. He's going to die anyway, and I'll come back with more of the gang to teach you a lesson,' the leader of the group snarls. A snap from the crocodile hurries the hyenas' retreat, rushing down the street and out of sight. Dr. Fuchs hurries back to his patient, the soldier's breathing becoming increasingly laboured.";
	say "     'I don't know what to do. The damage is too extensive for me to treat without more advanced medical apparatus than I have available,' Otto glumly notes. 'And I doubt that the machines in the hospital are still in working order. The mystery is how this man hasn't transformed in anyway.' The soldier stirs, opening his eyes and taking a sharp breath through clenched teeth. 'We were given immunity boosters, doc,' he answers quietly. 'But it will be running out soon, so if you keep me alive for long enough, I might heal, but I have too much pride to want to be a hyena. I'll be damned if I let them gain any small victory,' he says determinedly. While the doctor's expression briefly lightened at such a simple explanation to the puzzle and the course of action that might remedy it, the soldier's unwillingness to become a hyena to save himself returns him to looking pensive. The choice between acceding to the soldier's wishes and thus letting him die, or sustaining him until the immunosuppressants wear off and letting him turn into a hyena conflict on his face.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     To everyone's surprise, the black fox pipes up with a suggestion. 'The transformation doesn't have to be into a hyena. We could try and infect him with another species. A blood sample might have a greater concentration of whatever it is causing the transformations, so if we inject it into him, medical arguments aside, it might overpower any remnants of hyena DNA.' The onlookers' expressions vary from awe and curiosity to disgust. Dr Otto Fuchs rubs his chin as he thinks, contemplating the feasibility of the suggestion. 'I'm willing to try if you are,' the soldier croaks, his skin getting increasingly pale as his lifeblood pools on the road. 'I don't want to die if there is some merit to that idea.' Otto seems to come to a conclusion, 'It seems to be the only option left to save you, and it seems more ethical than either of the other two options. We just need a volunteer,' he states. To your surprise, the tiger and the crocodile both volunteer.";
	say "     'I wasn't expecting anyone to be willing to help me, as I'm sure word of what I did to that rabbit has spread,' the soldier says. Dr. Fuchs replies sympathetically, 'He survived and made a full physical recovery, but you're running out of time. It would seem that you have two volunteers, but you'll probably become their species so make your choice quickly but carefully. I understand that this will likely estrange you from the military, so you have my condolences,'  The soldier looks thoughtful for a moment before looking at you. 'I remember you from last time. What do you think? Who should I accept a blood transfusion from?' He doesn't seem to have a preference, the whole situation probably dulling his ability to think.";
	say "     [bold type]You think for a moment before replying...[roman type][line break]";

		say "     The large feline kneels down to make it easier for the nurse to get a blood sample. The young fox woman strokes the tiger's shoulder as she brings the needle of the syringe to his arm. He flinches slightly as it penetrates his skin, the vulpine's paw scratching behind his ears to soothe him. Blood is sucked into the vacuum as she withdraws the plunger, the red liquid the dying soldier's last hope. The fox pulls the needle out of the tiger's arm and passes the syringe to her superior, Otto watching the soldier intently as he waits for the immunosuppressants to wear off. It doesn't take long for this to happen, the human letting out a pained shout as bones reform violently. The crocodile and the wolf quickly try and hold him still to prevent him hurting himself further. Not missing a beat, Dr. Fuchs inserts the needle with precision directly into the thrashing soldier's deltoid, steadily injecting the fluid.";
		say "     For a moment, you think that this has killed him as he becomes completely limp. You realise how very wrong you were when his thrashing resumes, and the pained screams increase in intensity. Several of the onlookers turn away and cover their ears. Dr. Fuchs, seeing how concerned many of you are, shouts over the soldier, 'Probably a mixture of the infections fighting each other, incompatibility in blood types, and just the transformation process' normal effects. If his mind survives this, his body will too.' You're not sure whether this is reassuring or not. Froth trickles from the corner of the transforming human's mouth as tawny-orange fur pushes through his skin and his bones realign. His face fills out, forming into that of... a tiger. It seems that the gamble has paid off. The worst of it seemingly over, his body is no longer rigid. The shouts stop too, becoming weak grunts as the last transformations occur.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     Before you lies the newly-transformed tiger. The remains of his clothes have torn from his vulnerable form. Like his progenitor, he is covered in rich, black-and-orange-striped fur, a thick tail twitching beneath him. Letting out a sigh, he clambers to his feet and stands up. He has gained several inches in height, as well as elsewhere, judging from the size of his flaccid shaft. A cream-furred scrotum hangs between his legs, the fur on his inner thighs of similar colour. He gently feels over his new body, especially interested in what his face feels like. 'I can hear so much more... and the smells. This is going to take some getting used to. Thank you, sir,' he addresses the tiger. 'I would have died if you hadn't all saved me. Thank you, Dr. Fuchs, and you, Miss?' he says turning to the fox, waiting for her name. 'Genevieve,' the nurse replies, giving a small curtsy. The spectacle resolving with a happy ending, much of the crowd disperses, returning to their homes.";

Like his progenitor, he is covered in brown-green scales, a thick tail squashed underneath him. Letting out a sigh, he clambers to his feet and stands up. He has gained several inches in height. Between his legs, there is an absence of external genitalia, a discrete slit hopefully containing his penis. He gently feels over his new body, especially interested in what his face feels like. 'I can taste so much more... and the smells. This is going to take some getting used to. Thank you, sir,' he addresses the crocodile. 'I would have died if you hadn't all saved me.

The spectacle resolving with a happy ending, much of the crowd disperses, returning to their homes.";
	say "     The only people remaining are yourself, the ex-soldier, the two medical staff, and the three individuals that intimidated the hyenas. 'Thank the Pack for me the next time you see them. That wouldn't have gone nearly as well without you,' Otto addresses the wolf, gratitude obvious on his face. 'It would be a lot easier if you would accept the Den Mother's offer of protection, but we understand that you can help more people out here. But I better report to my Alpha, be careful, Otto.' He drops to all fours and runs down a side street, towards where you heard the howl earlier. Looking surprisingly grim, the larger tiger steps up to the doctor and rests his paw on his shoulder. 'We need to talk in private about what just happened.' Fuchs's shoulders slump, but he nods. A brief flash of anger crosses Genevieve's face at the tiger's words, but she quickly stifles this, giving you a grateful nod before gently guiding the recent patient towards Otto's house.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     The doctor turns to you and shakes your hand. 'You seem to turn up when things go pear-shaped, don't you? Almost as if you know when I'll need help. Thank you, hopefully I'll see you again under better circumstances next time.' The words seem foreboding after the tiger's request to him. Bidding them goodbye, you walk away down the street. Unseen by you, the crocodile and the tiger stonily escort Otto into his house and close the door behind themselves.";
