Version 1 of Bouncy Succubus by Qazarar begins here.

[I was thinking of a new monsters for the balloon castle in the ocean.

Basically a red demon/succubus inflatable who seeks to turn the PC either female or into a femboy with her main focus being turning the PC into a massive blimp/sextoy, using them as a sextoy/piece of furniture, reveling in their embarrassment while puffing them up.]

Section 1 - Monster Responses

BouncyCorruption is a number that varies.[@Tag:NotSaved]

to say BouncySuccubusLoss: [player loses]
	if inasituation is true: [special event]
		say ""; [dealt with in the file where the event is described]
	else: [regular scene]
		if BouncyCorruption < 2: [oral]
			say "     A";

			say "     A";
		else if BouncyCorruption < 6: [heavier inflation???]
			say "     A";
		else: [bad end]
			say "     A";

to say BouncySuccubusVictory: [player wins]
	if inasituation is true: [special event]
		say ""; [dealt with in the file where the event is described]
	else: [regular scene]
		say "     A";
		say "     [bold type]You could easily have your way with her if you want to.[roman type][line break]";

			say "     A";
		else:
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     You're not interested, or at least not now, and so you simply ignore the curious demon, and return to your adventures.";

to say BouncySuccubusDesc:
	say "     The most fitting adjective to describe what you see in front of you is [']bouncy['], in every way. The exaggerated feminine figure has all the hallmarks of a succubus, with curling demonic horns, an incredibly plump and well-endowed figure, bright red skin, and a cute spade tail. Even more eye catching than the rest of her are the sheer size and bounce of her chest, almost resembling a pair of balloonsâ€”a comparison that becomes all the more fitting as you take in her entirety again, and realize that in fact her entire body seems to be made of some sort of rubber, like an inflatable toy. Her chest isn't the only thing that's has that particular trait you realize, as her feminine mound is also quite affected, leaving it round and inflated.";
