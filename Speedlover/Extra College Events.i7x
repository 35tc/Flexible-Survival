	say "     Walking down a pathway in the college, two figures emerge from one side and sprint toward you. Hearing their shouts of joy even from the distance you are at, they quickly get close enough for you to make them out. A female antelope and male cheetah are neck and neck in a race, with legs that blur as they cross ground at an amazing pace. As they close in you notice there is a fence in the way. The antelope goes around it and grabs the metal pole at the edge to slingshot herself to regain some speed while the cheetah jumps over it. They both get back up to full speed again, but the cheetah is now clearly winning. The antelope gives it her best shot, but they both streak past you and cross a finish line – marked out with a bit of tape – before she can catch up.";
	Line Break;
	say "     'Ian, you're such a cheater!' She pants. He turns towards her and smirks 'I know.' Her nose scrunches in confusion for a second 'That's not what I... Oh when are you going to stop making that joke!' He laughs a little bit, 'When you manage to keep up.' She looks at him, her face pensive 'How about...' She stands and seductively drapes herself over him 'I show you how well I can keep up.' With a look on his face like he has won the lottery, Ian stumbles out a yes and they both dash off, presumably going somewhere private.";

One has been infected as a fox, and has fluffy fox ears on her head and a bushy tail poking through the back of the bench. She has an arm around her friend, a wolf anthro with a bulging stomach who is crying. The wolf girl has completely changed, complete with muzzle and fur all over. You step a bit closer and listen in.";
	say "     'It all happened so fast.' She sobs 'One minute I was studying with my boyfriend, the next hes one of those wolves!' her friend rubs her back 'Its good to talk about it, so what happened next?' she asks. 'Well he changed into one of those alphas, got real muscly, with a big you-know-what. I should have said no, he didn't have any condoms, but he just smelt so good and I let it happen' Her friend takes the opportunity to jump in 'It's ok, it's not your fault, so what happened next?'. The wolf takes a deep breath and lets it out 'Well we did the deed, and he finished in me. A few minutes later I turned into this and an hour after that [italic type]THIS[roman type]' she waves at her stomach 'started showing. He was really sorry after of course, got lost in his new instincts, but now I've got this...'";
	Line Break;
	say "     'Dont worry' the fox girl soothes 'Look, you aren't alone in this, there are more than a couple of girls in your situation, turns out they grow really fast at the moment! You should give birth tonight and the child will be fully grown in a matter of weeks, you can continue your degree!' The wolf looks up 'I can?' she questions, the fox girl nods and a small smile appears on the wolf girls face before the fox girl continues 'Looks like you need to start thinking of baby names! Cmon lets go and have a look at a list of them, see what would be a good one.'";
	Line Break;
	say "     They both get up from the bench and walk down the path. You step out from behind the bush you have been hiding in and head off to continue exploring.";

		say "     On your travels you spot a tennis court between buildings. There seems to be a game going on – between cats and dogs. One one side, a panther and a lynx. On the other side a husky and a labrador retriever. Anthro dogs and cats of many types are standing to one side watching the game. The game looks pretty intense, dogs loping around, hitting hard and trying to wear out the cats. On the other side the cats are playing tactically. Each of them stick to their positions like glue and they keep aiming for spots they think the dogs cant defend.";
		say "     You watch the yellow ball go from one side to the other a dozen times, both sides giving as good as they get, but nothing lasts forever. One of the cats hits high, causing the ball to go near the labradors head. Unfortunately for him, his instincts take over and [bold type]CHOMP[roman type]. Immediately the animals in the crowd yell in victory or defeat depending on their team and everyone starts to walk off. As they leave you hear the husky say to his teammate 'Again? That's the third ball this week!'";
		now CatsVSDogsCounter is 2;
	else if CatsVSDogsCounter is 2:
		say "     You spot the cats and dogs again, this time at a running track. There are a number of them wearing sporty clothes and stretching, getting limber for the run. A cat walks up to the side of the track at the finish line and lifts a gun. Immediately they all get into position side by side.";
		say "     The cat fires smoke into the air, and a second later they all sprint off as they hear the [bold type]BANG[roman type]. Immediately the cats etch out a small lead, legs pumping, ears flat. You notice something at the start, a greyhound shouts '[bold type]3[roman type]'. He launches off the line, catches and passes the dogs, slows down behind the cats and as the finish line approaches, gets around them just in time. The crowd back at the start line cheer and a large dog shouts [bold type]'ONE ALL'[roman type]. They all start walking towards the finish line, making you realise that you should be exploring the campus.";
