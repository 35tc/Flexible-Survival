Hearing their shouts of joy even from the distance you are at, they quickly get close enough for you to make them out. A female antelope and male cheetah are neck and neck in a race, with legs that blur as they cross ground at an amazing pace. As they close in you notice there is a fence in the way. The antelope goes around it and grabs the metal pole at the edge to slingshot herself to regain some speed while the cheetah jumps over it. They both get back up to full speed again, but the cheetah is now clearly winning. The antelope gives it her best shot, but they both streak past you and cross a finish line – marked out with a bit of tape – before she can catch up.";

Oh when are you going to stop making that joke!' He laughs a little bit, 'When you manage to keep up.' She looks at him, her face pensive. 'How about...' She stands and seductively drapes herself over him. 'I show you how well I can keep up.' With a look on his face like he has won the lottery, Ian stumbles out a yes and they both dash off, presumably going somewhere private.";

So what happened next?' she asks. 'Well, he changed into one of those alphas, got real muscly, with a big you-know-what. I should have said no, he didn't have any condoms, but he just smelt so good and I let it happen.' Her friend takes the opportunity to jump in and say, 'It's ok, it's not your fault. So what happened next?' The wolf takes a deep breath and lets it out. 'Well, we did the deed, and he finished in me. A few minutes later I turned into this, and an hour after that, [italic type]THIS[roman type]-' she waves at her stomach '-started showing.

The fox girl nods and a small smile appears on the wolf girl's face before the fox girl continues, 'Looks like you need to start thinking of baby names! C'mon, let's go and have a look at a list of them, see what would be a good one.'";

On the other side a husky and a Labrador retriever. Anthro dogs and cats of many types are standing to one side watching the game. The game looks pretty intense, dogs loping around, hitting hard and trying to wear out the cats. On the other side the cats are playing tactically. Each of them stick to their positions like glue and they keep aiming for spots they think the dogs cant defend.";

You notice something at the start, a greyhound shouts '[bold type]3[roman type]'. He launches off the line, catches and passes the dogs, slows down behind the cats and as the finish line approaches, gets around them just in time.

You take a seat a bit up the path and watch their antics for a minute, thankful for the cheer in an otherwise dreary city. From the opposite side you see a gryphon milkman come along, and you seem to notice him at the same time the two groups do. From each group a member steps forward and begins to walk towards the milkman. Suddenly they stop, look at each other, and both start running. Side by side they run to the milkman and side by side they tackle him. The two groups start cheering and patting each other on the back, watching the three of them fall to the ground.";

Each of them begin to enjoy their prizes, the cat chugging down the milk as if he hasn't had a drink for days and the dog fucking the gryphon. Unfortunately they forgot about getting infected and both of them begin to show signs. The cats back bulges for a second before he begins to sprout wings, and the dogs muzzle changes into a beak. Slowly the groups stop cheering and start muttering amongst themselves. You distinctly hear 'Gang-bang should fix that...' from one group.

	say "     Walking over the campus in the direction of the Tenvale college dorms, you notice after a few steps that something - or rather someone - is missing from your side. As you start turning around to see where your attack dog Korvin ended up, you hear the German shepherd bark out, 'What are you looking at, pup? Never seen a [italic type]real[roman type] dog before?' It turns out that Korvin stopped walking about a dozen feet back, where he is standing now, hands on his furry hips and looking down at a young adult anthro standing right in front of him. The other guy is a canine too, though shorter and of a different breed of dog - a beagle, you'd say, judging by the floppy ears and the mixture of white, tan and brown fur. Dressed in shorts and a t-shirt bearing the 'Tenvale College' logo, a backpack slung over one shoulder, the slender young man gapes at Korvin with wide eyes, then gasps out, 'I - I'm sorry sir! It's just... um, you're naked and...'";
	say "     'Hah!' Korvin barks, interrupting the canine student and stepping up right into his comfort zone. 'Real men have nothing to hide. Fur is everything you need!' With that, your anthro attack dog flexes his bicep and runs a hand over the rippling abs of his torso, grinning broadly at the beagle. The student is clearly overwhelmed by Korvin's 'in your face' attitude and is at a loss for words, just staring at the larger man's body and panting excitedly. You can see him stretch his head forward a little, nostrils flaring as he breathes in the masculine scent of your companion standing so very close, followed by his tail starting to wag cautiously. Korvin is quick to pick up on that too, the edges of his muzzle creasing in a toothy, hungry smile.";
	say "     [bold type]Do you allow the two to act out on their urges?[roman type][line break]";
	LineBreak;
	say "     ([link]Y[as]y[end link]) - Yeah, why not. Dogs will be dogs and all that...";
	say "     ([link]N[as]n[end link]) - Nope! You tamed Korvin from being a wild dog who was attacking people in the streets. Best not to let him fall back to that.";
	if player consents:
		LineBreak;
		say "     Placing a hand on the student's shoulder and sliding it up to wrap his fingers behind his neck, Korvin asks, 'What's your name, boy?' Panting hard, the beagle replies, 'G-Gibson, sir!' Pulling the young man closer till his muzzle is pressed against his own furry pecs, Korvin leans forward to lick the side of his face and the floppy ear of the younger canine. 'Good dog, Gib! Someone taught you well to treat a top dog like he deserves!' Your collared dog gives a rough chuckle and lowers a hand to Gibson's crotch. Shivering, the college student takes a deep breath of your attack dog's masculine scent and begins to let his hands wander a bit, carefully pressing them up against Korvin's toned form, as if fearful he might be reprimanded. When one of Gibson's hands gravitate towards his firm buttocks, the German Shepherd can't help but grin. 'Getting into the spirit now, aren't you?' he says with amusement in his voice.";
		say "     'Nice bulge, little doggy. Let's see what you're packing,' Korvin barks to his... captive? Eager partner? Fellow dog? All of the above, you'd say. He loosens his grip and allows Gibson to raise his head from the muscled pec it was pressed against, then licks the smaller dog's muzzle. With an aroused growl, Korvin half-leads, half-drags the student into the bushes flanking the walkway.";

		LineBreak;
		say "     ([link]Y[as]y[end link]) - Anthro dogs humping in rut? Sure!";

			LineBreak;
			say "     Walking closer, you step through the opening between the bushes planted at the edge of the path, finding yourself in the shadow underneath a tree. The place is fairly out of sight from the walkway but open to the grassy meadow between the buildings of the campus. One or two students are lying on the grass nearby, studying or dozing, and a trio farther off to the side is playing with a Frisbee (often catching it with their teeth out of reflex). Gibson's backpack is lying on the ground a step in front of you, while the canine young adult is pushed against the trunk of the tree by Korvin. Your attack dog is quick to peel his college t-shirt off, throwing it your way and chuckling as it hits your head. Pulling the garment off your face - the fresh but at the same time masculine scent of the young dog still in your nose - you drop it next to the student's backpack. By the time you look back at them, Korvin is undoing the smaller canine's zipper.";
			say "     Pulling Gibson's pants down with a sudden and forceful yank, Korvin looks his new friend up and down in all his naked glory. The young man is slender and a bit shorter than him, but still has some nice musculature on his frame. The difference between his and Korvin's breed is fairly obvious: one type is mainly used for tracking, whereas the other is bigger, stronger - suitable for both herding sheep and taking down wolves. Though that's not the only thing that sets them apart - as Korvin points out when he grabs at Gibson's crotch and barks, 'Now what is this?!' His paw-hand wraps around the young man's pink-ish penis, holding the normal human-like appendage up and then stroking it a few times. 'No wonder you were staring at my crotch! You're definitively missing out boy! A sheath and knot are great. But hey, I know how to fix you up,' Korvin adds with a laugh, then pushes on his companion's shoulders.";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     Too stunned to resist, Gibson soon finds himself crouching down in front of Korvin, staring with wonder at his bright red canine cock. His gaze wanders over the pointy tip, vein-covered shaft, and the bulge at the base, a thick furry sheath nestled just below the knot. 'Wow,' the young dog murmurs under his breath, then reaches out to cup Korvin's balls, gently playing the furry orbs between his fingers. 'Yeah, have a good look at it,' Korvin barks out, pride clearly audible in his voice. He leans over Gibson, bracing himself against the tree as he looks down on the student and letting him touch his erection at his heart's content. The stroking and squeezes that the curious young man gives him aren't without effect, as soon a drop of pre-cum forms at the slit of Korvin's dickhead. You can see him start to reach down to pull Gibson's muzzle to it, but before the German shepherd even touches the other dog, he already has stretched his neck and lapped at Korvin's dick on his own.";
			say "     Gripping the tree tightly with both hand-paws again, Korvin grins down at his student and grunts in arousal as Gibson quickly progresses to taking his shaft in his mouth - helped greatly by the length of a canine muzzle as compared to a human mouth. And so, even as an obvious novice at giving blowjobs, the anthro young adult soon is bobbing up and down on his horny partner's rod - all the while stroking his own shaft with a steady rhythm. Korvin greatly enjoys introducing the beagle to oral male on male sex, instructing him with panted out words of direction, then eventually grasping him by the hair to keep him steady as he proceeds to face-fuck Gibson. It doesn't take long after that until he reaches his climax, taking care to keep his knot out of the anthro student's muzzle as he starts to pump out his creamy cum, covering the young man's tongue and hitting the back of his throat again and again. After all, it wouldn't do to give Gibson a lockjaw at his very first blowjob.";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     As Korvin pumps his German shepherd nut-milk into Gibson, grunting in satisfaction as the other canine gobbles it down eagerly, you can see from your close by position that something immediately starts happening to the student's own erection. Its pink-ish human flesh starts to darken second by second, becoming redder in color, and the formerly mushroom-like head reforms to a more pointed shape. Soon, the young man's hand that is gripping the base of his cock starts to be pushed apart a little, and when he pulls back his fingers, you see a fully grown canine knot there too. Grunting around Korvin's muzzle still in his mouth, a jolt goes through the whole of Gibson's body as his newly formed cock erupts, spraying canine seed all over the ground between Korvin's legs.";
			say "     Your collared attack dog keeps gently humping into his partner's muzzle until his own throbs of cum ebb off, then gives the student some time to lick up every last drop of cum and worship his cock some more. Tousling the beagle's short hair and floppy ears, Korvin eventually steps back from the tree and looks down at his now fully anthro canine shape and the puddle of cum on the ground. 'Told ya it'd be fun, Gib!' Still licking his muzzle and checking out his new canine cock, the young man looks up at your companion and replies, 'Thank you, sir. For... everything. That was just... wow.' He makes puppy eyes full of adoration at Korvin, who basks in the feeling - until Gibson suddenly freezes with a somewhat horrified look on his face and looks down to his watch. 'SHIT! I'm late for class!' the student wails, jumping up from where he was leaning back against the tree and snatching up his clothes and backpack before setting off at a sprint, naked. Korvin laughs heartily at the end of his fling with the beagle and takes his usual position by your side again.";

But then... that is not the only area close by that one can hear sounds of sex from. Passersby barely raise an eyebrow at the noises of your attack dog and his new partner. Quite a change in behaviour to 'normal' human society before the nanite apocalypse...";
			say "     Eventually, Korvin re-emerges from the bushes, a broad grin on his face and his canine shaft still half-hard outside his sheath. It is glistening with wetness, but you can't see a drop of cum on it anywhere... which leaves a pretty easy guess where it all ended up. He takes his usual position by your side with a smirk, looking back to where a pleased and somewhat bewildered-looking Gibson comes stumbling out of the bushes a moment later, still licking his muzzle. Then the young man looks down at his watch and his hackles rise, followed by him letting out a shout of, 'Shit! I'm late for class!' and hurriedly sprinting past you and your companion.";

Ordering the black-collared German shepherd to heel, you make eye-contact with Korvin as his lips start to show a little scowl, holding the stare until he looks down submissively a few moments later. With a sidelong glance at the beagle and a bark of, 'So long, pup!' Korvin then trots back over to you, taking his usual position. You hook a finger under the collar marking him as yours and adjust it a little to remind him of his status. Then you pat his head like a good dog and start moving on. The beagle student is left behind, staring after the dominant dog with a sigh of relief - and a sliver of regret.";
