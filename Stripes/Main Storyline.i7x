'Welcome to Trevor Labs,' he says and extends a gloved hand to shake yours. 'I am Doctor Matthew Burnell, but most just call me Doctor Matt. Since I didn't hear any sounds of a scuffle from below, I presume Orthas let you in? She wouldn't do that with a crazed infectee, so it's nice to meet you.' ";
		if scenario is "Researcher":
			say "He focuses his gaze on you for a moment, then comments, 'You don't look nearly as lost and confused as most. Are you another researcher? Excellent. I'm looking into a cure for this plague, but my research is just in the beginning stages to be honest. There is something else of interest however...";
		else:
			say "He laughs a little, nervous and forced. 'Anyway, before you ask, no, we did not have anything to do with the nanite infestation. You didn't know it was nanites? Now you do. I have been studying them for some time since the grid went dark. I'm not much closer to a cure... but I did find something else of interest however,' he says, pausing for effect.";
		say "     'I can manipulate existing strains, just a little, for those already infected, like you. Don't look at me like that. Anyone not in a fully sealed environment is infected by now. [if humanity of player < 80]In fact, I'd say you've already been pretty badly infected. Interesting... [end if]But now for the good news. As you develop resistances to the nanite infection and your system becomes stronger, I can redirect that growth to amazing, and planned, almost superhuman abilities,' he declares, sounding quite proud of himself. 'There's only one catch... I haven't had any test subjects to actually try it on so far. The creatures roaming around outside are too far gone to even talk to, and Orthas has to stay on post to guard the entrance.' The man gives you a calculating gaze, then adds in a persuasive tone, 'So how about you? You could [bold type]volunteer[roman type] for some tests, and we'll make you better than when you started. That'll help your chances to outlast this situation and what you might encounter outside and allow me to progress in my research. A fair deal, right?'";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     He doesn't really wait for you to reply, instead immediately turning to one of the monitors and starting a new file about 'Test Subject B'. Under his breath, the man murmurs to himself, 'Maybe the authorities will finally listen to me about delaying if I can show some first results. They simply must learn to understand that throwing more people at this will be worse than useless unless they know what they're getting into.'";

With critical deadlines to meet for one of my projects, I was doing an all-nighter. Then morning came and... I heard an alarmingly loud crash from downstairs, followed by other noises. Of course I couldn't simply go and check it out since I was in the class 4 isolation lab. It became obvious that a fight was going on when I heard the gunshots during my airlock procedure, but by the time the outer door finally opened, all was quiet again. I feared the worst and ran towards the lobby while still in my suit, only to find a wholly different scene than I had imagined. Oh, the room was thrashed thoroughly to be sure, but the huge draconic creature that was pinning our night security guard to the floor wasn't interested in actually harming him at all.'";
	say "     'Imagine my surprise at seeing what appeared to be a car-sized quadrupedal reptile on top of Mr. Janakos, engaged in sexual intercourse. A fascinating sight for sure, seeing that the creature didn't seem to belong to any natural genus, having six limbs in all, four legs and two wings. Also, it was sodomizing its human partner with a significantly over-sized penis without apparent harm to his well-being. In fact, he was moaning in arousal from the treatment.' Dr. Matt shrugs a little as he recounts this, his tone of voice relaxed and neutral, showing that he's more interested in factual matters than judging. 'Unable to affect the creature by myself in any way, the only thing I could do was observe, dictating some whispered notes into this suit's audio pickups. After the creature eventually deposited its seed, it wandered off, leaving me free to come to its groaning victim's help.'";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Dr. Matt recounts rushing downstairs with a large medkit he grabbed from a wall holder at the lab entrance, only to find the security guard in almost perfect health, the last signs of bruises and cuts vanishing before his very eyes. Yet then a kind of rash started spreading over his skin, with it becoming black and scaly. Hastily rushing his patient upstairs to the lab, Dr. Matt examined him, which the organized researcher captured on video too. A moment later, you're watching a computer screen, showing the image of a naked and Greek-American man lying on a stretcher. He's quite well built, broad shouldered and strong, and you can see the text 'Test Subject A: Orthus Janakos' in the corner of the screen. Over the next several minutes, you see him transform into the anthro dragoness you know as Orthas, all of which is narrated by Dr. Matt - even though you could have done well without being told just which bone breaking is responsible for what crunch.";
	say "     'I knew something had to be done to find the cause of this contagion, and a cure, so I went right back to work afterwards. As it turned out, nanites are the culprits here and they have wide-ranging transformative, as well as libido increasing, effects. I was quite lucky that I had no time to take off my suit in that first rush towards the lobby, otherwise I might very well be just another of the unfortunate victims of the nanite plague.' The suited man points to a large security window with embedded wire in the back of his lab, and the airlock beside it. 'To remain unaffected and be able to work on researching the nanites, I had to re-purpose the isolation lab as living quarters. It is somewhat amusing that a room that originally held samples of virulent diseases now has become my refuge and the one place I can take off this suit. Also, I really have to recommend Orthas for her sense of duty. Without her to keep guard even after her transformation, I would never have been able to remain here.'";

	say "     The suited man looks up at you as you bring up connecting with the world outside of the city, glancing at you through his glasses and nodding. 'Yes, I do still have contact with a colleague in the CDC, Dr. Sutton. As luck will have it, the Trevor Labs facility is part of the shielded communications network that connects a number of selected sites of bio-safety level 4 in case of emergencies. If only Greg and I could have convinced the authorities that they have to delay the planned surge of troops into the city!' He distractedly moves to stroke through his grey hair, only to have his gloved fingers bump against the Plexiglas screen of the helmet. Lowering his hand with an annoyed grunt, Dr. Matt makes a frustrated throwing-away gesture.";
	say "     'They just won't listen! Sending more troops will only expand the ranks of the infected unless they're properly prepared. And for that, we need more research!' The man focuses on yourself with an intense expression that speaks of his desperate need for progress, and the frustration of a scientist at being rushed. He adds in a grumbling tone, 'The infighting out there is almost as bad as the beasts out on the streets here. Politicians screaming for something to be done yesterday, generals drawing in what local forces they can and preparing for a Hail-Mary push to 'overwhelm the beasts', with those who understand anything about the situation in the middle and ignored by both.
