[ ^^ Genital Descriptions Done ]
[big changes are needed here to incorporate genital slits, cloaca, and such.]
[As far as cock size goes it's tedious to have something like "monstrous 30 inch cock", since 30 inches already lets us know this. However what we DO need is actual cock width aka girth and how thick this cock is. We also need proper ball options, for example we have size and that shows us how much cum we shoot, but what about ball count? People have shown interest in the ability to have as many as 4 and as little as 1 although the 1 is usually in the form of a huge uniball.]
[Onto pussy choices. As far as width goes it can work if its on par with persons size aka size 3 person with 3 foot wide vagina seems unlikely but not impossible, however when I played I always viewed width in the same grouping as tightness. Both depth and tightness should go into what can be inserted, obviously at a decent penalty for not being able to actually handle content either in the form of separate scenes where they cant be penetrated or they simply force it in causing a decent decrease in sanity.]
