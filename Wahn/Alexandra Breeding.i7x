For Breeding Alexandra
Player
Likes/fetishes: male doms, female subs or power bottom, Impregnation/Breeding, pregnancy, threesomes/multiple partners, collars with titles on them like breeder, tattoos with titles on them like breeder, oral and dirty talk for cock and ball worship, big balls, lots of cum, dirty talk
Dislikes: vore, unbirth, death, permanent appearance tf, mind control [90% of the time], hard bondage by itself
Other comments: I like culting and peer pressure, like if someone likes getting bred they also what others to get bred too and they want to help make that happen, coerce them, and/or force them to do it. But it's nothing they wouldn't do themselves and prefer would do it with them and help them revel in the good parts
I like it when someone is so interested in something that the conviction they have drives them to find others to help or make them experience it.

Character
The gender of my player character is (usually): male or female
Feats my character often/always has: fertile, litter bearer, and other gameplay feats that help me level and loot
Does the character usually use Automatic Survival?: no

Scenes
Pairings that interest me are (keep those that are fine by you): MF, FF, HF, HH
I prefer creature gender to be: female or male

When losing a fight, I like as its aftermath: sex, sub, food and water taken
The following creatures I like the most (why?): most M or H/F
The following creatures I dislike the most (why?): those with content I don't like or cause tf easily
This creature or infection could use an update (multiple possible, say what you think needs work): minotaur
I'd love to see as new creature: new tentacle monster

NPCs
I always/often bring home/visit these NPCs: always most to all of the ladies, when playing female I usually pick up fang and most of the men that are sexable art bunker except the pig
Threesomes and/or extra scenes between these bunker/library NPCs would be awesome:
The following NPCs I like the most (why?): Alexandra Nadia, Fang, Amy, Sarah and other ladies that interact with others
The following NPCs I dislike the most (why?): pig and because he is a slob
