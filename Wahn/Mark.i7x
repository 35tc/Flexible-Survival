The conversation of Mark is { "<This is nothing but a placeholder!>" }.
The scent of Mark is "     Mark smells nicely masculine, a bit musky and there is also a definite undertone of... wood-smoke? Definitively a real man's scent!".

	say "     Mark is a big and burly polar bear, about seven feet tall and with very broad shoulders. He has the typical snow white fur of his species, with a somewhat anthropomorphic head and a muzzle full of a predator's teeth. Much of the big man's bulk is muscle, filling out the rugged jeans and checkered flannel shirt of his outfit quite well. Overall, the powerful bear has definite similarities to the stereotypical image of a woodcutter, although he clearly has no need for an axe to be reckoned with. The sharp claws on his paw-hands are plenty already.";
	say "     Noticing your attention, Mark turns his gaze towards you in turn, meeting your eyes with his own dark amber ones. Then the man gives you a brief nod, acknowledging your presence.";

Went through high school, got a job or three as a after that, until I ended up a waiter. And that's where I ended up meeting the love of my life while I was serving him... hmm, I think it was Ostropel. Romanian restaurant, you know.' Smiling to himself, he continues, 'Living with Jay has been amazing. We've been together five years now. Not in our current forms, of course. These transformations have brought some change, but we still feel as we always have about one another. It's just that I am now the big strong one, and he's my little sex kitten. Not that he isn't as headstrong as ever about getting what he wants - its just that he has different needs. And even if all this is completely upside-down to before, both of us love it.'";
	say "     Changing to topic back to himself, the burly polar bear pats the bicep on his right arm and explains, 'As for what I'm doing these days: it's scavenging, out in the city. Not a glamorous job, but a necessary one. The mall may have a lot in its storerooms, but things won't last forever, so bringing in whatever I can find just makes sense. And if I can find something special for Jay, even better.' He stops for a moment and looks you up and down, then says, 'You know, there are some places and things I don't go for alone, even if I'm built like a brick house now. Wanna maybe head out together sometime? Meet me here in the morning, if you do.'";

to say MarkTalk2: [talk about Jay]
	say "     As you ask the large polar bear about his partner, the man grins broadly and replies, 'He is quite something, isn't he? The perfect little package - sexy, funny and strong in character. And what's best - Jay's a total slut for my cock. Hell, I fuck him a few times a day, and still wake up with my man's trembling hole stretched around my hard shaft. He just climbs on it and rides me. Best way to be woken up, I can tell you that!' The memories of being with his lover create a noticeable tent in Mark's pants, which he adjusts without any shyness, pushing his dick to the side and creating a clearly visible outline of a hard shaft. 'Fuck yeah, I love that man. Been doing that since the day we met, five years ago, even though things were quite different back then of course. I was his bottom boy, not the other way around.'";
	say "     Waving a hand to indicate his muscular bulk, the man explains, 'Forget this bear you see for a moment, and imagine a slender dude. Neither a twink or a bodybuilder, just thin and fit. Anyways, I was working at a downtown restaurant - 'Tati's', a pretty nice Romanian place, little bit fancy - and there was this attractive hunk of a man with some older guy. Oh yeah, Jay was really hot that night, tailored suit and everything. Gave him some winks, and before I knew, he took me as dessert. Pushed me into the restrooms and fucked my mouth in the handicapped stall.' A pleased sigh crosses his lips, with Mark looking a bit dreamily. 'Barely took three months before he asked for my hand, and I gave it to him.' Raising a large and clawed paw-hand, the bear wiggles his pinkie finger - the only one small enough to fit the broad gold band of a human-sized ring that he proudly presents to you.";

to say MarkScavengingTalk:
	say "     As you step up to the large polar bear and ask about details on his scavenging trips, Mark grins broadly and pats your back. 'Well, I can't just tell you where all the best spots for salvage are in the city, that's possibly make us compete. But hey, there are a number of spots out there that have plenty for both of us - you know, those places where one shouldn't really go alone anyways. So how about it - wanna meet me here in the morning and come with for an excursion sometime?' You reply that you'll think about it and the big man nods, giving you a thoughtful look.";

'Good choice, friend. Together, we'll be able to go for some truly worthwhile targets.' Adjusting the straps of his backpack, the big man then leads you out through the doors of the mall, and the two of you wander across the parking lot to go explore the chaos-ruled city. Things are slow at first, with Mark guiding you past countless cars and houses that clearly have already been looted. After an hour or so, he suddenly stretches out his arm to the side, preventing you from walking any further, and nods to something a little distance ahead.";

Pretty well hidden from sight too, and I don't think that anyone or anything even knows its there. The problem is keeping it that way. Most of the infected have a good sense of smell, so cutting up a pumpkin might bring them sniffing. And if I carry a 300 pound pumpkin off in one piece, I'll be vulnerable to anything wanting to jump me,' the large polar bear says, then pats your shoulder with a clawed paw-hand and grins. 'That's where you come in now.' [or]'Ready for another trip to the pumpkin patch? Hopefully it's still our little secret. We were careful after all. Same plan as before - I carry one of those big things, and you keep lookout,' the large polar bear says, then pats your shoulder with a clawed paw-hand and grins.

With that said, the snow-white bear crouches down and wraps both arms around the pumpkin, lifting it with a strained grunt.
